### Agent-1 Updates Already Completed
Agent-1 has already made the following updates:
1. Added release note entry to `/Users/yoenzhang/Downloads/docs/release-notes/version-4/sdk-changelog.mdx`
2. Release note properly categorizes changes:
   - One improvement (enhanced anchoring)

### Documentation Impact Assessment

#### 1. Comment Anchoring Improvement
This is an **internal enhancement** that:
- Does NOT add new API methods or hooks
- Does NOT change existing method signatures or parameters
- Does NOT require users to change their code
- Does NOT introduce new configuration options
- Simply improves the underlying positioning logic for existing comment types (pin, text, area)
- Makes comments more reliable on dynamic websites

**Conclusion**: No documentation updates needed since this is a transparent improvement to existing functionality.

#### 2. SquareSpace-Specific Bug Fixes
Both bug fixes are **site-specific fixes** that:
- Do NOT change the API surface
- Do NOT add new parameters or methods
- Do NOT require user configuration
- Do NOT change documented behavior
- Simply fix rendering issues specific to SquareSpace websites
- Return the functionality to its intended state

**Conclusion**: No documentation updates needed since these are bug fixes that restore proper behavior without API changes.

#### 3. Existing Documentation Analysis
Current comment documentation already covers:
- Pin comments setup: `/Users/yoenzhang/Downloads/docs/async-collaboration/comments/setup/freestyle.mdx`
- Text comments setup: `/Users/yoenzhang/Downloads/docs/async-collaboration/comments/setup/text.mdx`
- Area comments: Covered in freestyle documentation
- Comment positioning: Not explicitly documented as it's handled automatically by the SDK

The existing documentation remains accurate because:
- Comment setup steps are unchanged
- API methods and hooks are unchanged
- User-facing behavior is unchanged
- These improvements happen automatically without user intervention

## Additional Notes

### Platform-Specific Fixes Context
While this release includes SquareSpace-specific fixes, this doesn't mean we need platform-specific documentation because:
1. The SDK handles platform compatibility automatically
2. Users don't configure different behavior for different platforms
3. Setup steps are identical across all platforms
4. Comments work the same way regardless of the underlying website platform

### Anchoring Mechanism Technical Details
The "fallback mechanism" and "enhanced element detection" mentioned in the release note are:
- Internal SDK improvements
- Not exposed through the API
- Not configurable by users
- Applied automatically without user intervention
- Not appropriate for user-facing documentation

### Future Considerations
If Velt introduces **configurable** options for comment anchoring or positioning in future releases, those would require documentation updates. However, this release's improvements are entirely automatic and internal.
