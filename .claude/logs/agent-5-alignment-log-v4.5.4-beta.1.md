**Compliance Status**: ✅ COMPLIANT with Velt documentation standards

---

## Documentation Alignment Updates

### Update 1: Standalone ThreadCard Documentation

**File**: `/Users/yoenzhang/Downloads/docs/ui-customization/features/async/comments/comment-dialog/subcomponents/body/subcomponents/threadcard.mdx`

**Changes Made:**
1. Added `<VeltCommentDialogWireframe.ThreadCard.Reply />` to React example (line 33)
2. Added `<velt-comment-dialog-thread-card-reply-wireframe></velt-comment-dialog-thread-card-reply-wireframe>` to HTML example (line 56)

**Justification**: This standalone file documents the ThreadCard component structure. The new Reply subcomponent must be included to maintain consistency with the main documentation and ensure developers see all available subcomponents.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

---

### Update 2: Body Overview Documentation

**File**: `/Users/yoenzhang/Downloads/docs/ui-customization/features/async/comments/comment-dialog/subcomponents/body/overview.mdx`

**Changes Made:**
1. Added `<VeltCommentDialogWireframe.HideReply />` to React example (line 27)
2. Added `<velt-comment-dialog-hide-reply-wireframe></velt-comment-dialog-hide-reply-wireframe>` to HTML example (line 43)

**Justification**: This file provides an overview of the Body component and its direct children. HideReply is a direct child of Body and must be included in the overview to accurately represent the component hierarchy.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

---

### Update 3: Canonical Structure Documentation

**File**: `/Users/yoenzhang/Downloads/docs/ui-customization/features/async/comments/comment-dialog-structure.mdx`

**Changes Made:**

#### React Section (Lines 110-123):
- Added `VeltCommentDialogWireframe.ThreadCard.Reply` to ThreadCard subcomponents list (line 123)
- Marked as **(Leaf)** - has no child components

#### React Section (Lines 177-182):
- Added new section for `VeltCommentDialogWireframe.HideReply` (lines 177-180)
- Documented as having no direct children

#### HTML Section (Lines 344-357):
- Added `velt-comment-dialog-thread-card-reply-wireframe` to thread-card subcomponents list (line 357)
- Marked as **(Leaf)** - has no child components

#### HTML Section (Lines 409-411):
- Added new section for `velt-comment-dialog-hide-reply-wireframe` (lines 409-410)
- Documented as having no direct children

**Justification**: The canonical structure document serves as the single source of truth for all wireframe component hierarchies. Both new components must be documented here to maintain architectural consistency and provide developers with accurate component structure reference.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

| body/overview.mdx | 18 | React first, HTML second | ✅ |

**Result**: ✅ All tab structures follow Velt standards

---

### Wireframe Wrapper Verification

**Standard**: All wireframe examples must include parent wrapper

| Location | React Wrapper | HTML Wrapper | Status |
|----------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| ThreadCard.Reply (main docs) | `<VeltWireframe>` | `<velt-wireframe style="display:none;">` | ✅ |
| HideReply (main docs) | `<VeltWireframe>` | `<velt-wireframe style="display:none;">` | ✅ |
| threadcard.mdx | `<VeltWireframe>` | `<velt-wireframe style="display:none;">` | ✅ |

**Result**: ✅ All examples include proper wireframe wrappers

---

### HTML Tag Format Verification

**Standard**: Use separate opening and closing tags (NOT self-closing)

**Verification**: All HTML wireframe tags verified to use format:
```html
<velt-component-wireframe></velt-component-wireframe>
```

**NOT**:
```html
<velt-component-wireframe />
```

**Result**: ✅ All HTML tags use correct format

## Known Limitations and Follow-Up Items

### Image Assets (LOW Priority)
**Issue**: Both ThreadCard.Reply and HideReply components are missing image frames.

**Current State**: Image placeholders are not included in the documentation.

**Recommendation**:
- Design team needs to provide images:
  - `Reply (Body Threads Thread Card).png`
  - `Hide Reply (Body).png`

**Agent-6 Action**: Flag this for design team follow-up. This is not a blocker for QA approval as images are typically provided after documentation alignment.

---

### Subcomponent Investigation (COMPLETED)
**Issue**: Agent-2 noted the need to investigate if HideReply has subcomponents like ToggleReply does.

**Resolution**: Agent-4's documentation and the canonical structure indicate HideReply has no subcomponents. This has been correctly documented as `*(no direct children)*` in the structure document.

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

---
