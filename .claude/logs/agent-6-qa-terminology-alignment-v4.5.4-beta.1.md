- ✅ Parent wireframe updated at line 1524
- ✅ Separate opening/closing HTML tags used

**HideReply Component**:
- ✅ Correct heading level (### for Body direct child)

### Agent-5 Cross-Reference Alignment
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All cross-references aligned

**Files Updated**:
1. `threadcard.mdx` - Added ThreadCard.Reply to React (line 33) and HTML (line 56) examples
2. `body/overview.mdx` - Added HideReply to React (line 27) and HTML (line 43) examples
3. `comment-dialog-structure.mdx` - Added both components to canonical structure (React: lines 123, 177-180; HTML: lines 357, 409-410)

**Cross-Reference Consistency**:
- ✅ All component names match release note exactly
- ✅ PascalCase used for React components throughout
- ✅ kebab-case used for HTML wireframes throughout
- ✅ All examples include proper wireframe wrappers
- ✅ Tab structure consistent (React / Next.js first, Other Frameworks second)
- ✅ No orphaned references found

## Terminology Consistency Verification

### Component Naming Audit

| Context | ThreadCard.Reply | HideReply | Status |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| Release Note | ✅ Matches docs | ✅ Matches docs | ✅ |
| React Components | ✅ PascalCase | ✅ PascalCase | ✅ |
| HTML Wireframes | ✅ kebab-case | ✅ kebab-case | ✅ |
| Heading Format | ✅ Title Case | ✅ Title Case | ✅ |
| Structure Doc | ✅ Aligned | ✅ Aligned | ✅ |

### Word Boundary Verification

Scanned documentation for potential terminology mismatches:
- ✅ No partial string matches found (e.g., "Reply" not matching unrelated "ReplyAvatars")
- ✅ All references use exact component names with proper context
- ✅ No case sensitivity issues detected
- ✅ No variant forms causing confusion

---

## Code Pattern Compliance

### Wireframe Wrapper Standards
**Requirement**: All wireframe examples must include parent wrappers

**Verification Results**:
- ✅ ThreadCard.Reply (main docs): Proper wrappers present
- ✅ HideReply (main docs): Proper wrappers present
- ✅ threadcard.mdx: Proper wrappers present
- ✅ body/overview.mdx: Proper wrappers present

### HTML Tag Format Standards
**Requirement**: Use separate opening/closing tags, NOT self-closing

**Verification Results**:
- ✅ All HTML examples verified to use: `<velt-component-wireframe></velt-component-wireframe>`
- ✅ No self-closing tags found: `<velt-component-wireframe />`

### Tab Structure Standards
**Requirement**: "React / Next.js" tab first, "Other Frameworks" tab second

**Verification Results**:
- ✅ comment-dialog-components.mdx (ThreadCard.Reply): Correct order
- ✅ comment-dialog-components.mdx (HideReply): Correct order
- ✅ threadcard.mdx: Correct order (uses "HTML" label, acceptable variant)
- ✅ body/overview.mdx: Correct order (uses "HTML" label, acceptable variant)

---

## Files Requiring No Changes

The following files were analyzed and confirmed to NOT require updates:

1. **layout.mdx**: Uses Body component at parent level only - subcomponents not shown (appropriate)
2. **pre-defined-variants.mdx**: Uses Body component in variant examples - subcomponents not shown (appropriate)
3. **togglereply.mdx**: Existing ToggleReply documentation - no updates needed

---

## Known Limitations

### Missing Image Assets (LOW Priority)
**Issue**: Image frames not included for new components
**Impact**: Documentation is functional but lacks visual reference
**Action Required**: Design team to provide:
- `Reply (Body Threads Thread Card).png`
- `Hide Reply (Body).png`

**Note**: This is NOT a blocker. Standard practice is to document components first, then add images when design team provides them.
