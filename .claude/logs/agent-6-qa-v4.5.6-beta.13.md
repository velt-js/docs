## Validation Results

### 1. Core Terminology Consistency ✅

#### verifyUserPermissions (11 instances in documentation)
- ✅ Consistently used in camelCase with backticks in technical contexts
- ✅ Properly documented in v2 REST API endpoints (Add Notifications, Update Notifications)
- ✅ Correctly referenced in release notes and overview documentation
- ✅ Default value `false` consistently documented

**Files verified:**
- `/api-reference/rest-apis/v2/notifications/add-notifications.mdx`
- `/api-reference/rest-apis/v2/notifications/update-notifications.mdx`
- `/async-collaboration/notifications/overview.mdx`
- `/release-notes/version-4/sdk-changelog.mdx`

#### notifyUsers vs targetUsers ✅
- ✅ **Zero instances** of incorrect `targetUsers` found in documentation
- ✅ All REST API references correctly use `notifyUsers`
- ✅ Parameter naming consistent across v1 and v2 APIs

**Validation:**
```bash
Search pattern: \btargetUsers\b
Result: No matches found (excluding .claude/logs)
```

### 2. Feature Name Capitalization ✅

#### Permission Provider (17 capitalized instances, 2 contextual lowercase)
- ✅ Title case "Permission Provider" used consistently when referring to the feature
- ✅ Lowercase "permission provider" appropriately used in 2 technical contexts:
  - Line 1524 in `key-concepts/overview.mdx`: "configure the permission provider" (API method reference)
  - Line 2068 in `api-reference/sdk/api/api-methods.mdx`: "Configure a permission provider" (method description)
- ✅ These lowercase uses are contextually appropriate per technical writing standards

**Files verified:**
- `/key-concepts/overview.mdx` (authentication section, real-time provider section)
- `/api-reference/sdk/api/api-methods.mdx` (setPermissionProvider method)
- `/async-collaboration/notifications/overview.mdx` (integration notes)
- `/get-started/quickstart.mdx` (permission provider reference)

#### Access Control (Title case used appropriately)
- ✅ "Access Control" capitalized when referring to the feature name
- ✅ "access control" lowercase used correctly in descriptive/general contexts
- ✅ Proper distinction between feature references and general terminology

**Pattern validated:**
- Feature reference: "Access Control Integration" (section heading)
- General use: "access control settings" (descriptive text)
- API anchor: `#access-control` (URL slug - lowercase appropriate)

### 3. UI Element Naming ✅

#### "For You" and "Documents" tabs
- ✅ Consistently quoted and title-cased throughout documentation
- ✅ Release notes correctly state: `Notifications in "For You" and "Documents" tabs`
- ✅ Overview page consistently uses: `"For You" tab` and `"Documents" tabs`
- ✅ No inconsistencies in capitalization or quoting found

**Files verified:**
- `/release-notes/version-4/sdk-changelog.mdx` (line 17)
- `/async-collaboration/notifications/overview.mdx` (lines 12, 34)
- `/async-collaboration/notifications/customize-behavior.mdx` (multiple references)

#### Email notifications
- ✅ Consistently lowercase "email notifications" in running text
- ✅ Properly documented blocking behavior for inaccessible documents
- ✅ Clear integration with Permission Provider documented

---

## Cross-Reference Validation ✅

### REST API Documentation Links
All cross-reference links validated and working:

1. ✅ Release notes → Add Notifications v2 API
2. ✅ Release notes → Update Notifications v2 API
3. ✅ Notifications overview → Add Notifications v2 API
4. ✅ Notifications overview → Update Notifications v2 API
5. ✅ Notifications overview → Access Control documentation
6. ✅ Notifications overview → Permission Provider section
7. ✅ Key concepts → Generate Signature API

### Parameter Documentation Alignment ✅
- ✅ Add Notifications v2: `verifyUserPermissions` parameter fully documented (line 48-53)
- ✅ Update Notifications v2: `verifyUserPermissions` parameter fully documented (line 44-49)
- ✅ Both APIs include comprehensive examples with the new parameter
- ✅ v1 APIs correctly reference v2 for advanced features

---

## Code Example Validation ✅

#### Add Notifications API (lines 22-53 in sdk-changelog.mdx)
```bash
✅ Includes verifyUserPermissions: true
✅ Proper JSON structure
✅ Complete parameter list
✅ Matches API documentation format
```

#### Update Notifications API (lines 56-74 in sdk-changelog.mdx)
```bash

✅ Proper JSON structure
✅ Matches API documentation format
```

#### Notifications Overview Example (lines 43-64)
```bash
✅ Shows verifyUserPermissions usage

- ✅ Links to API documentation functional

### Notifications Overview (overview.mdx)
- ✅ "Access Control Integration" section added (lines 29-68)
- ✅ Clear explanation of automatic filtering behavior
- ✅ Email protection behavior documented
- ✅ REST API control section included
- ✅ Proper Note component usage for important information

### REST API Documentation
- ✅ Add Notifications v2: New parameter section added in correct position (after actionUser)
- ✅ Update Notifications v2: New parameter section added in correct position (after userId)
- ✅ Both include default value documentation
- ✅ Both include contextual examples with Permission Verification
- ✅ Both include explanatory Notes about behavior

## Recommendations

### For Agent-1 (Next Release Note Processing)
✅ **Ready to proceed** - Documentation is in excellent state for processing the next release note.

### For Future Releases
1. **Maintain current quality standards** - Agent-2 and Agent-3 demonstrated excellent attention to:
   - Terminology consistency
   - Parameter placement logic
   - Example completeness
   - Cross-reference accuracy

2. **Continue Permission Provider integration pattern** - The v4.5.6-beta.13 documentation provides a strong template for how to document feature integrations with Permission Provider.

3. **Access Control documentation pattern** - The "Access Control Integration" section in notifications overview is a good model for future feature integrations.

## Agent-6 QA Methodology

### Validation Approach
1. **Comprehensive terminology searches** - Used word boundary patterns to ensure accurate matching
2. **Multi-variant detection** - Checked for case variations, plurals, and compound terms
3. **Contextual validation** - Verified appropriate use of title case vs lowercase
4. **Cross-reference verification** - Tested all internal documentation links
5. **Code example validation** - Checked JSON syntax and parameter accuracy
6. **Pattern consistency** - Validated against Velt project standards

### Tools Used
```bash
- rg (ripgrep) for pattern matching with word boundaries
- Grep tool for content searches across documentation
- Read tool for detailed file validation
- Manual review of critical integration points
```
