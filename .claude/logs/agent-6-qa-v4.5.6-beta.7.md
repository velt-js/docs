## Issues Found: 1 (Pre-existing, Fixed by Agent-5)

### 1. react-hooks.mdx - Incorrect cross-reference link
**Location**: Line 406 in `/Users/yoenzhang/Downloads/docs/api-reference/sdk/api/react-hooks.mdx`
**Issue**: `useLiveStateSyncUtils()` hook documentation linked to Single Editor Mode instead of Live State Sync

## Comprehensive QA Validation Results

### 1. Version Number Accuracy
✓ All references use correct version: `v4.5.6-beta.7`
✓ Release date accurate: October 8, 2025
✓ Consistent across all 5 modified files

### 2. Terminology Consistency
✓ Feature name: "Live State Sync" (consistent capitalization)
✓ Method name: `fetchLiveStateData()` (camelCase)
✓ Parameter name: `liveStateDataId` (camelCase, consistent)
✓ Interface name: `FetchLiveStateDataRequest` (PascalCase)
✓ Type references: `Promise<T>` (proper TypeScript generic syntax)

### 3. Code Example Validation

#### Tab Structure (All Correct)
✓ React/Next.js tab always appears first
✓ Other Frameworks tab appears second
✓ Tab titles use exact format: "React / Next.js" and "Other Frameworks"

#### React Tab Content Validation
✓ Hook examples clearly separated with "// Using Hooks" comment
✓ API method examples clearly separated with "// Using API methods" comment
✓ API methods correctly use `client` prefix: `client.getLiveStateSyncElement()`
✓ Hook examples use `useLiveStateSyncUtils()` correctly
✓ TypeScript example includes proper interface definition
✓ Generic type syntax correct: `fetchLiveStateData<MyDataType>()`

#### Other Frameworks Tab Content Validation
✓ API methods correctly use `Velt` prefix: `Velt.getLiveStateSyncElement()`
✓ HTML `<script>` tags used appropriately in changelog
✓ No mixing of React and vanilla JS syntax

### 4. Cross-Reference Link Validation
✓ api-methods.mdx → data-models.mdx: `#fetchlivestatedatarequest` (working)
✓ api-methods.mdx → setup.mdx: `#fetch-live-data` (working)
✓ react-hooks.mdx → setup.mdx: `/realtime-collaboration/live-state-sync/setup` (FIXED by Agent-5)
✓ All anchor formats use lowercase with hyphens (Mintlify standard)

### 5. Documentation Structure Validation
✓ Changelog follows structure: New Features → [subsection heading]
✓ Feature name used as subsection: "Live State Sync"
✓ No duplicate section headings within version
✓ Code examples follow feature description
✓ Proper use of Mintlify components: `<Tabs>`, `<Tab>`, `<Update>`

### 6. Content Accuracy and Completeness

#### Release Note (sdk-changelog.mdx)
✓ Method description accurate and concise
✓ Feature classification correct: "New Features"
✓ Both hook and API examples provided
✓ Examples demonstrate all use cases (fetch all data, fetch specific ID)

#### Data Models (data-models.mdx)
✓ Interface definition complete with all properties
✓ Property types accurate: `liveStateDataId: string`
✓ Required field correctly marked as optional
✓ Description clear and comprehensive

#### API Methods (api-methods.mdx)
✓ Method signature documented: `fetchLiveStateData<T>(request?: FetchLiveStateDataRequest)`
✓ Return type documented: `Promise<T>`
✓ Generic type support explained
✓ React Hook status: correctly marked as `n/a`
✓ Cross-reference links included

#### Setup Guide (setup.mdx)
✓ New "Fetch Live Data" section added with heading level 3
✓ Comparison guidance provided: when to use fetch vs get
✓ All parameters documented with types
✓ Return type documented with generic support explanation
✓ Multiple examples: basic, specific ID, TypeScript typed
✓ Common use cases listed
✓ Proper placement: after "Get Live Data", before "Alternative: useLiveState()"

### 7. JSON/TypeScript Code Formatting
✓ Interface syntax correct: `interface MyDataType { ... }`
✓ Generic type syntax correct: `<MyDataType>`
✓ Object literal syntax correct: `{ liveStateDataId: "..." }`
✓ Async/await syntax correct: `await liveStateSyncElement.fetchLiveStateData()`
✓ Optional parameter syntax correct: `request?:`

### 8. Velt-Specific Requirements

#### Terminology Alignment
✓ "Live State Sync" used consistently (not "Live State Data" feature name)
✓ No use of deprecated terminology
✓ Client references appropriate per context (React vs vanilla)

#### Code Pattern Consistency
✓ React examples separate hooks from API methods
✓ API methods use correct prefix (`client` vs `Velt`)
✓ No inline type definitions (properly linked to data-models.mdx)
✓ Comment conventions followed

## Terminology Alignment Operations

### Safe Search/Replace Operations Performed: 0
**Reason**: Agent-5 completed comprehensive alignment scan and found no terminology inconsistencies requiring repo-wide search/replace operations. All terminology was already consistent:
- Feature naming: "Live State Sync" consistently used
- Method naming: `fetchLiveStateData()` consistently used
- Parameter naming: `liveStateDataId` consistently used
- No variants or alternate spellings found

### Manual Validation Checks: 8
1. Version number consistency (v4.5.6-beta.7) - PASSED
2. Terminology case consistency - PASSED
3. Tab structure validation - PASSED
4. Code example syntax validation - PASSED
5. Cross-reference link validation - PASSED (1 pre-existing issue fixed)
6. Anchor format consistency - PASSED
7. Generic type syntax validation - PASSED
8. Client/Velt prefix validation - PASSED
