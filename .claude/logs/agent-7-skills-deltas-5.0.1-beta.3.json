  "reason": "All changes in this release are Comments-only (HTML/Vanilla SDK). The two improvements introduce no new API methods, props, hooks, events, or wireframe names that are currently taught by any skill rule. Improvement 1 (V4 backward compatibility aliases for allowAssignment, allowEdit, allowToggleNotification, allowChangeCommentAccessMode) adds aliases to existing props whose names do not appear anywhere in the velt-comments-best-practices skill library — no skill rule teaches OptionsDropdownProps prop-level names. Improvement 2 (edit composer wireframe reuse) is an internal rendering change with no wireframe name or API surface change; the affected wireframe names are not enumerated in any skill rule. All 12 bug fixes restore prior v4 behavior with no API or documented behavior change and therefore do not qualify under the guardrails. No CRDT or Notifications changes exist in this release.",

No skill rule references OptionsDropdownProps prop-level names. Backward compatibility means existing code continues to work — no developer action required, no skill guidance needed."
