Version Range: v4.5.6-beta.1 to v4.5.6-beta.8

## Bug Fixes

- [Comments]: Fixed an issue where tagged users who don't exist in the database were not displaying correctly in email notifications. Comments now render with the proper format in both the UI and emails.

- [Comments]: Fixed an issue where user mentions in email notifications were not resolving with correct user details. Tagged users in comments now display properly with accurate information in all email notifications.

- [Comments]: Fixed an issue where user details were not resolving when a user from a different organization added comments in an accessible document. This previously caused skeleton loading states or fallback formatting for existing organization users, but now displays correctly.

- [Live State Sync]: The useServerConnectionStateChangeHandler hook was sometimes incorrectly reporting an offline state due to the behavior of our special listener in a multi-tab environment. When a browser throttled an idle tab, it would interfere with the shared network activity for this specific listener. This caused the listener in active tabs to momentarily and incorrectly return a false (disconnected) status, even though the primary database connection remained active. We added a 1.5s delay to resolve the network state before emitting the value in the hook.

- [Recorder]: Fixed an issue where the control panel was not visible in thread mode.

- [Comments]: Fixed an issue with manual comment pin selection when working with draft comment annotations.

- [Single Editor Mode]: Fixed an issue related to switching editor access when heartbeat is disabled.

## Improvements

- [Single Editor Mode]: Improved offline handling for Single Editor Mode controls. When you're offline and attempt to use the "Edit Here" button or accept/reject actions, these operations are now prevented and a console warning is displayed.

- [Live State Sync]: Added timestamp field to Redux action data in Live State Sync. Each action now includes a UTC timestamp for better tracking and debugging.

## New Features

- [Live State Sync]: Added fetchLiveStateData() method to retrieve synced state data. You can fetch all synced data or retrieve data for a specific liveStateDataId.

- [Live State Sync]: Added heartbeat feature for Single Editor Mode. The heartbeat mechanism provides more reliable presence detection in single editor mode scenarios. This feature is enabled by default when single editor mode is enabled. If you want to disable heartbeat functionality, you must disable it before enabling single editor mode.
