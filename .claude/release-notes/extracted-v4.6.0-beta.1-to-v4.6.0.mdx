Version Range: v4.6.0-beta.1 to v4.6.0

## New Features

- [**Core**]: Added `getCurrentUser()` method to subscribe to user object changes. You can now detect when the current user's data updates in real-time.

## Improvements

- [**Comments**]: Added `commentPinClicked` event to detect pin interactions. You can now capture click events on comment pins to track user engagement.

- [**Comments**]: Added `readOnly` property to Comments Sidebar. Sidebar comment dialogs can now be set to read-only mode to prevent edits.

- [**Comments**]: Fixed tabindex behavior in all comment components. When a component is hidden or empty, tabindex is now removed to prevent focus on invisible elements.

- [**Comments**]: Added default access context in comments feature. This ensures that all relevant comments are fetched in the query if you are using feature level permissions using access context.

- [**Comments**]: Extended private comments feature to support both admin and organization users.

- [**REST APIs**]: Added `verifyUserPermissions` flag to [Add Comment Annotations](/api-reference/rest-apis/v2/comments-feature/comment-annotations/add-comment-annotations), [Add Comments in Comment Annotation](/api-reference/rest-apis/v2/comments-feature/comments/add-comments), [Add Notifications](/api-reference/rest-apis/v2/notifications/add-notifications), and [Update Notifications](/api-reference/rest-apis/v2/notifications/update-notifications) REST APIs. When enabled, these operations are only performed for users who have access to the specified document, preventing unauthorized resource creation or updates.
