Hey Velt Developers!

Here's what shipped from `v4.5.2-beta.3` until `v4.5.5` across Comments, Access Control, Recorder, Notifications, and Single Editor Mode.

:speech_balloon: *Comments*

* Added full-screen mode for [Comments Sidebar](https://docs.velt.dev/ui-customization/features/async/comments/comment-sidebar-components) to maximize space for reviewing and managing large volumes of comments.
* Added fixed annotation numbers to comment pins and dialogs that persist across sessions, making it easier to reference specific comments in discussions and documentation.
* Added search by annotation number in [Comments Sidebar](https://docs.velt.dev/ui-customization/features/async/comments/comment-sidebar-components) to quickly find comments by typing their annotation number (e.g., `#2`).
* Added attachments data support in [REST API endpoints](https://docs.velt.dev/api-reference/rest-apis/v2/comments-feature/comments/add-comments) for programmatic inclusion of attachment metadata with file properties and custom data.
* Added `setComposerFileAttachments()` API method to programmatically add file attachments to the comment composer.
* Added `readOnly` flag to [Comment Bubble component](https://docs.velt.dev/async-collaboration/comments/customize-behavior#readonly) to prevent users from replying or editing comments.
* Added `disabled` flag to [Comment Tool component](https://docs.velt.dev/async-collaboration/comments/customize-behavior#disabled) to disable adding new comments while preserving view access.
* Added Edited chip in comment thread to make edits visibly transparent at a glance, improving auditability and helping reviewers quickly spot updated messages in long discussions.
* Added clickable selection links with [link callback](https://docs.velt.dev/async-collaboration/comments/customize-behavior#link-callback-for-clickable-links) and Slack-style link pasting (select text, paste URL to create hyperlink).
* Added group support for [custom lists](https://docs.velt.dev/async-collaboration/comments/customize-behavior#createcustomlistdataoncomment), useful for workflows like issue trackers to organize and insert custom entities.

:closed_lock_with_key: *Access Control*

* Launched [User Permissions API](https://docs.velt.dev/api-reference/rest-apis/v2/auth/get-permissions) to fetch a user's `editor`/`viewer` access across organizations, folders, and documents.
* Introduced support for [viewer and editor roles](https://docs.velt.dev/key-concepts/overview#roles): Editor role provides full read/write access, while Viewer role provides read-only access.

:movie_camera: *Recorder*

* Added [Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode](https://docs.velt.dev/async-collaboration/recorder/customize-behavior#enablepictureinpicture) for screen recordings with camera, enabling multitasking while recording (Chrome-only, disabled by default).
* Added [screen recording preview](https://docs.velt.dev/async-collaboration/recorder/customize-behavior#requestscreenpermission) to let users preview their screen before starting the recording.
* Added [maximum recording length](https://docs.velt.dev/async-collaboration/recorder/customize-behavior#setmaxlength) feature to set time limits on recordings to manage storage costs.
* Added configuration to [control playback behavior on preview click](https://docs.velt.dev/async-collaboration/recorder/customize-behavior#playbackonpreviewclick) for enabling or disabling click-to-play/pause.

:bell: *Notifications*

* Added `considerAllNotifications` to control notification counts: includes all tabs when enabled, or only "For You" tab when disabled (default).
* Added ability to [filter notifications](https://docs.velt.dev/async-collaboration/notifications/customize-behavior#enablecurrentdocumentonly) to the currently set document only (default shows 15 most recent documents).

:busts_in_silhouette: *Single Editor Mode*

* Added `updateUserPresence` to send heartbeat data, helping Velt detect multi-tab activity and resolve the active editor as a fallback.
