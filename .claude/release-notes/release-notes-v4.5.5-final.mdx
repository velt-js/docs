Hey Velt Developers!

Here's what shipped in v4.5.5 across Comments, Access Control, Recorder, Notifications, and Single Editor Mode.

:speech_balloon: Comments

- Added full-screen mode for [Comments Sidebar](https://docs.velt.dev/async-collaboration/comments/customize-ui/sidebar) to maximize space for reviewing and managing comments, particularly useful when working with large volumes of feedback or conducting detailed comment reviews.
- Added fixed annotation numbers to comment pins and dialogs that persist across sessions, making it easier to reference specific comments in discussions and documentation.
- Added search by annotation number in [Comments Sidebar](https://docs.velt.dev/async-collaboration/comments/customize-ui/sidebar), allowing users to quickly find specific comments by typing their annotation number (e.g., `#2`) in the search field.
- Added attachments data support in [REST API endpoints](https://docs.velt.dev/api-reference/rest-apis/comments/add-comment) for adding and updating comments, enabling programmatic inclusion of attachment metadata with comprehensive file properties (`attachmentId`, `name`, `size`, `type`, `URL`, `thumbnail`, `mimeType`) and custom metadata.
- Added [`setComposerFileAttachments()`](https://docs.velt.dev/async-collaboration/comments/customize-behavior/general-controls#set-attachments-programmatically) API method to programmatically add file attachments to the comment composer from your application instead of requiring users to select files from the file system.
- Added `readOnly` flag to [Comment Bubble component](https://docs.velt.dev/async-collaboration/comments/customize-behavior/general-controls#set-comment-bubbles-as-read-only) to prevent users from replying or editing existing comments in the target bubble while still displaying them, useful for read-only viewing scenarios.
- Added `disabled` flag to [Comment Tool component](https://docs.velt.dev/async-collaboration/comments/customize-behavior/general-controls#disable-comment-tool) to disable the comment tool and prevent users from adding new comments while still allowing them to view existing comments.
- Added Edited chip in comment thread to make edits visibly transparent at a glance, improving auditability and helping reviewers quickly spot updated messages in long discussions.
- Added clickable links of text selection in comments and a [link callback](https://docs.velt.dev/async-collaboration/comments/customize-behavior/action-callbacks#on-comment-selection-link-click) to handle link clicks programmatically.
- Added Slack-style link pasting: select text and paste a link to directly convert it into a clickable hyperlink, speeding up authoring with familiar UX.
- Added group support for [custom lists](https://docs.velt.dev/async-collaboration/comments/customize-behavior/action-event-handlers#custom-category-list-opened), useful for workflows like issue trackers (e.g., group by "Priority" or "Status"), allowing users to quickly refer and insert custom entities from your app.

:closed_lock_with_key: Access Control

- Launched [User Permissions API](https://docs.velt.dev/security/access-control/user-permissions#get-user-permissions) to fetch a user's `editor`/`viewer` access across organizations, folders, and documents for both permanent and temporary users, helping enforce read-only experiences.
- Introduced support for [viewer and editor roles](https://docs.velt.dev/security/access-control/user-permissions#viewer-vs-editor) for permanent and temporary users: Editor role provides full read/write access to collaboration data (create/edit/delete comments and replies, add reactions, start recordings), while Viewer role provides read-only access (view comments, presence, cursors, recordings, notifications) without modification ability.
- Updated [Get User Permissions API](https://docs.velt.dev/security/access-control/user-permissions#get-user-permissions) to remove `userIds` from the request payload and now returns structured error codes alongside permission denied messages for clearer error handling and easier programmatic diagnosis of permission issues.
- Users with Viewer access can no longer add comments or update metadata through the SDK, ensuring proper permission enforcement on Velt features.

:movie_camera: Recorder

- Added [Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode](https://docs.velt.dev/async-collaboration/recorder/customize-behavior/general-controls#enable-picture-in-picture-mode) for screen recordings when camera is enabled, allowing users to continue recording while multitasking and improving workflow efficiency for tutorial creation and documentation (Chrome-only, disabled by default).
- Added [screen recording preview](https://docs.velt.dev/async-collaboration/recorder/customize-behavior/general-controls#enable-screen-recording-preview) to let users see their screen recordings preview prior to starting the recording, helping users make necessary adjustments before recording begins.
- Added [maximum recording length](https://docs.velt.dev/async-collaboration/recorder/customize-behavior/general-controls#set-maximum-recording-time) feature that allows setting time limits on recordings to help manage storage costs and ensure recordings stay focused and relevant.
- Added configuration to [control playback behavior on preview click](https://docs.velt.dev/async-collaboration/recorder/customize-behavior/general-controls#enable-disable-playback-on-preview-click), enabling or disabling the click-to-play/pause functionality on recording previews.

:bell: Notifications

- Added [`considerAllNotifications`](https://docs.velt.dev/async-collaboration/notifications/customize-behavior/general-controls#count-only-for-you-notifications) configuration to the notifications tool to control the notification count and unread indicator: when enabled, counts include items from all tabs; when disabled (default), only includes items from the "For You" tab.
- Added ability to [filter notifications](https://docs.velt.dev/async-collaboration/notifications/customize-behavior/general-controls#filter-notifications-by-current-document) to the currently set document only (by default shows notifications for the 15 most recently active documents accessible to the current user in the current organization).

:busts_in_silhouette: Single Editor Mode

- Added [`updateUserPresence`](https://docs.velt.dev/users/single-editor-mode/setup#send-heartbeat-from-your-app) to send heartbeat data from the host app, helping Velt detect multi-tab activity and resolve who is the active editor when users switch tabs or devices as a fallback in rare edge cases if it fails to detect multi-tab/device presence.

Happy shipping! :rocket:
