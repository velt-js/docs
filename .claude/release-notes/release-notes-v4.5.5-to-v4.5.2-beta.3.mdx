Hey Velt Developers!

Here's what shipped from version 4.5.2-beta.3 to 4.5.5 across Comments, Access Control, Recorder, Notifications, and Single Editor Mode.

:speech_balloon: Comments

- Added full-screen mode for Comments Sidebar to maximize space for reviewing and managing comments, particularly useful when working with large volumes of feedback or conducting detailed comment reviews
- Added fixed annotation numbers to comment pins and dialogs that persist across sessions, making it easier to reference specific comments in discussions and documentation
- Added search by annotation number in Comments Sidebar, allowing users to quickly find specific comments by typing their annotation number (e.g., `#2`) in the search field
- Added attachments data support in REST API endpoints for adding and updating comments, enabling programmatic inclusion of attachment metadata with comprehensive file properties (`attachmentId`, `name`, `size`, `type`, `URL`, `thumbnail`, `mimeType`) and custom metadata
- Added `setComposerFileAttachments()` API method to programmatically add file attachments to the comment composer from your application instead of requiring users to select files from the file system
- Added `readOnly` flag to Comment Bubble component to prevent users from replying or editing existing comments in the target bubble while still displaying them, useful for read-only viewing scenarios
- Added `disabled` flag to Comment Tool component to disable the comment tool and prevent users from adding new comments while still allowing them to view existing comments
- Added Edited chip in comment thread to make edits visibly transparent at a glance, improving auditability and helping reviewers quickly spot updated messages in long discussions
- Added clickable links of text selection in comments and a link callback to handle link clicks programmatically
- Added Slack-style link pasting: select text and paste a link to directly convert it into a clickable hyperlink, speeding up authoring with familiar UX
- Added group support for custom lists, useful for workflows like issue trackers (e.g., group by "Priority" or "Status"), allowing users to quickly refer and insert custom entities from your app

:closed_lock_with_key: Access Control

- Launched User Permissions API to fetch a user's `editor`/`viewer` access across organizations, folders, and documents for both permanent and temporary users, helping enforce read-only experiences
- Introduced support for viewer and editor roles for permanent and temporary users: Editor role provides full read/write access to collaboration data (create/edit/delete comments and replies, add reactions, start recordings), while Viewer role provides read-only access (view comments, presence, cursors, recordings, notifications) without modification ability
- Updated Get User Permissions API to remove `userIds` from the request payload and now returns structured error codes alongside permission denied messages for clearer error handling and easier programmatic diagnosis of permission issues
- Users with Viewer access can no longer add comments or update metadata through the SDK, ensuring proper permission enforcement on Velt features

:movie_camera: Recorder

- Added Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode for screen recordings when camera is enabled, allowing users to continue recording while multitasking and improving workflow efficiency for tutorial creation and documentation (Chrome-only, disabled by default)
- Added screen recording preview to let users see their screen recordings preview prior to starting the recording, helping users make necessary adjustments before recording begins
- Added maximum recording length feature that allows setting time limits on recordings to help manage storage costs and ensure recordings stay focused and relevant
- Added configuration to control playback behavior on preview click, enabling or disabling the click-to-play/pause functionality on recording previews

:bell: Notifications

- Added `considerAllNotifications` configuration to the notifications tool to control the notification count and unread indicator: when enabled, counts include items from all tabs; when disabled (default), only includes items from the "For You" tab
- Added ability to filter notifications to the currently set document only (by default shows notifications for the 15 most recently active documents accessible to the current user in the current organization)

:pencil2: Single Editor Mode

- Added `updateUserPresence` to send heartbeat data from the host app, helping Velt detect multi-tab activity and resolve who is the active editor when users switch tabs or devices as a fallback in rare edge cases if it fails to detect multi-tab/device presence
