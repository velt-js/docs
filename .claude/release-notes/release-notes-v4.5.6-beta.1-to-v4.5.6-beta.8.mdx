Hey Velt Developers!

Here's what shipped from `v4.5.6-beta.1` until `v4.5.6-beta.8`:

:crystal_ball: *Live State Sync*

* Added `fetchLiveStateData()` method to retrieve all synced state or data for a specific `liveStateDataId`. [Learn more](https://docs.velt.dev/realtime-collaboration/live-state-sync/setup#fetch-live-data).
* Added [heartbeat feature](https://docs.velt.dev/realtime-collaboration/single-editor-mode/customize-behavior#heartbeat) for Single Editor Mode providing reliable presence detection. Default: enabled.
* Made [Single Editor Mode](https://docs.velt.dev/realtime-collaboration/single-editor-mode/setup) more robust for various edge cases, including handling offline-to-online transitions and multi-tab scenarios with improved connection state detection.

We also added several improvements across [comments](https://docs.velt.dev/async-collaboration/comments/customize-behavior) and [recording](https://docs.velt.dev/ui-customization/features/async/recorder/control-panel#control-panel) features.

For all the detailed changes and examples, check the [Velt SDK Changelog](https://docs.velt.dev/release-notes/version-4/sdk-changelog).

Happy shipping! :rocket:
