Hey Velt Developers!

Here's what shipped from `v4.6.0-beta.1` until `v4.6.1` across Core, Comments, and REST APIs.

:gear: *Core*

- Added `getCurrentUser()` method to subscribe to user object changes in real-time.
- Added validation in `getUserPermissions()` to check if user is set before proceeding.

:speech_balloon: *Comments*

- Added `commentPinClicked` event to detect pin interactions and track user engagement.
- Added `readOnly` property to Comments Sidebar for read-only mode to prevent edits.
- Added default access context to ensure relevant comments are fetched with feature-level permissions. [Learn more](https://docs.velt.dev/key-concepts/overview#set-feature-level-permissions-using-access-context-custom-metadata).

:globe_with_meridians: *REST APIs*

- Added `verifyUserPermissions` flag to [Add Comment Annotations](https://docs.velt.dev/api-reference/rest-apis/v2/comments-feature/comment-annotations/add-comment-annotations), [Add Comments in Comment Annotation](https://docs.velt.dev/api-reference/rest-apis/v2/comments-feature/comments/add-comments), [Add Notifications](https://docs.velt.dev/api-reference/rest-apis/v2/notifications/add-notifications), and [Update Notifications](https://docs.velt.dev/api-reference/rest-apis/v2/notifications/update-notifications) REST APIs to prevent unauthorized resource creation or updates.
