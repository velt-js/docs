:gear: *Core*

- Added `getCurrentUser()` method to subscribe to user object changes in real-time.
- Added validation in `getUserPermissions()` to check if user is set before proceeding.

:speech_balloon: Comments

Added commentPinClicked event to detect pin interactions and track user engagement.
Added readOnly property to Comments Sidebar for read-only mode to prevent edits.
Extended private comments feature to support both admin and organization users.
Added default access context to ensure relevant comments are fetched with feature-level permissions. Learn more.

:globe_with_meridians: REST APIs

Added verifyUserPermissions flag to Add Comment Annotations, Add Comments in Comment Annotation, Add Notifications, and Update Notifications REST APIs to prevent unauthorized resource creation or updates.
