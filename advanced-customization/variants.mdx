If you want to have multiple versions of customized components that you can swap between, you can use `variants`.


<Note>
The customization docs for each component will mention if any of them have pre-defined variants.

## 1. Defining Multiple Variants

To define multiple `variants`, add multiple templates of the same component `wireframe` to the `VeltWireframe` component and give them each a `variant` name.


```jsx
<VeltWireframe>

    <VeltCommentsSidebarWireframe variant=”sidebar1”>
        #Your wireframe for variant sidebar1
    </VeltCommentsSidebarWireframe>

    <VeltCommentsSidebarWireframe variant=”sidebar2”>
        #Your wireframe for variant sidebar2
    </VeltCommentsSidebarWireframe>
</VeltWireframe>
```

## 2. Using Variants

To use a specific variant, define it on the `variant` props when using the Velt component in your app.


```jsx
<div>
    <VeltCommentsSidebar variant="sidebar2"/>
</div>
```


## 3. Pre-defined Variants


Some components have pre-defined `variants`, these are reserved `variant` names that have specific functionality based on the component they are associated with.

Pre-defined `variants` don't need to be explicity mentioned as a `variant` props when using the Velt component in your app.

To customize pre-defined `variants`, you still need to add them to a `wireframe` template.

For example, the `Comment Dialog` has two pre-defined `variants`:

```jsx
<VeltWireframe>
{/* This pre-defined variant will change the appearance of the Comment Dialog within Pin, Area, and Text comments only */}
<VeltCommentDialogWireframe variant=”dialog”>
    ...
</VeltCommentDialogWireframe>

{/* This pre-defined variant will change the appearance of the Comment Dialog within the Sidebar only */}
<VeltCommentDialogWireframe variant=”sidebar”>
    ...
</VeltCommentDialogWireframe>
</VeltWireframe>
```


## 4. Unsupported Components


Some components currently do not support `variants`. 

Please check the customization docs for each component to check if `variants` are supported or not.

## 1. Adding Multiple Variants

To define multiple `variants`, add multiple templates of the same component `wireframe` to the `velt-wireframe` component and give them each a `variant` name.


```jsx
<velt-wireframe style="display:none;">
    <velt-comments-sidebar-wireframe variant=”sidebar1”>
        #Your wireframe for variant sidebar1
    </velt-comments-sidebar-wireframe>

    <velt-comments-sidebar-wireframe variant=”sidebar2”>
        #Your wireframe for variant sidebar2
    </velt-comments-sidebar-wireframe>
</velt-wireframe>
```


## 2. Using Variants

To use a specific variant, define it on the `variant` props when using the Velt component in your app.


```jsx
<div>
    <velts-comments-sidebar variant="sidebar2"></velt-comments-sidebar>
</div>
```

        <velt-comment-dialog-header-wireframe></velt-comment-dialog-header-wireframe>
    </velt-comment-dialog-wireframe>

    <!-- This pre-defined variant will change the appearance of the Comment Dialog within the Sidebar only -->
    <velt-comment-dialog-wireframe variant="sidebar">
