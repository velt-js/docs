Use this API to remove all user data from Velt. This will:
- remove their access from all the documents and data in the organization.
- remove them from @mention contact dropdown list.
- remove them from @mentions where they were tagged.
- remove them from all the feature data. eg: comments, reactions, notifications etc.

<Warning>
This API may take up to 5 minutes to return a 201 response since it runs an asynchronous job to delete user data across the system. To speed up this process, you can optionally provide the organizationIds where the user belongs.
