## Disable ShadowDOM
By default, a ShadowDOM is used with certain components to ensure that your applicationâ€™s CSS does not interfere with the styling of the SDK components.

`Default: enabled`

If you want to customize the comment player timeline using custom CSS, you can do so by disabling the ShadowDOM.


### Example
<Tabs>

<Tab title="React / Next.js">
```jsx
<VeltCommentPlayerTimeline shadowDom={false} />
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="HTML">

```jsx
<velt-comment-player-timeline shadow-dom="false"></velt-comment-player-timeline>
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>
