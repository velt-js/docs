Within any charts library you have the option to manually set the position of a Comment Annotation using the `Comment Pin` component.
## How to Use
Use `Comment Pin` in combination with the following:
1. `onCommentAdd`: Add custom metadata when adding a comment. This metadata can be used later to set the position of the Comment Pin. [Learn more](/async-collaboration/comments/customize-behavior/event-handlers)
2. `getAllCommentAnnotations`: Get all Comment Annotations with the custom metadata you set using above. Render the Comment Pin component and use the custom metadata to set its position yourself.
Note for react developers hooks are also available. [Learn more](/async-collaboration/comments/customize-behavior#getcommentannotations)
