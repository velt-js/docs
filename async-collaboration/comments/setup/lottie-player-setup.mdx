<Steps>

<Step title="Import Velt Components and Providers">
Import the folllowing component from Velt:
- `VeltProvider`: Bootstraps Velt SDK.
- `VeltComments`: Renders comments on the DOM.
- `VeltCommentTool`: Enables or disables adding comments.
- `VeltCommentPlayerTimeline`: Adds comments bubble over your player seek bar.
- `VeltCommentsSidebar`: Adds a sidebar that shows all comments. Users can also search, filter & navigate to the comments from here.
- `VeltSidebarButton`: Toggles the sidebar on/off.


```js
import {
  VeltProvider,
  VeltComments,
  VeltCommentTool,
  VeltCommentPlayerTimeline,
  VeltCommentsSidebar,
  VeltSidebarButton
} from '@veltdev/react';
```

</Step>

<Step title="Add <VeltProvider> to the root of your app and pass in your API key.">
```jsx
<VeltProvider apiKey="YOUR_API_KEY">
  <YourRootComponent />
</VeltProvider>
```
</Step>

<Step title="Authenticate your logged in user with the SDK.">
In your auth component, call the `identify()` method and pass in your User object in this format.

```jsx
await client.identify(user);
```

</Step>

<Step title="Set the Document ID.">
On the app page component where your player loads, call the `setDocumentId()` method and pass in an unique ID that represents the file that the player loads.

```jsx
client.setDocumentId('file-unique-id');
```
</Step>

<Step title="Add Velt Components in your app">

### 5a. Add the `VeltComments` component in the root of your app

Add the `VeltComments` component to enable the Comment feature in your app.

Enable the follow attributes to be `true`:

- `priority`: allows user to P0, P1, or P2 as priority. You can customize this list.
- `autoCategorize`: allows AI to categorize comment as Question, Feedback, Bug, Other. You can customize this list.
- `commentIndex`: shows a small icon showing index of the comment in order of creation.


```jsx
<VeltComments priority={true} autoCategorize={true} commentIndex={true}/>
```

### 5b. Add the `VeltCommentTool` component wherever you want your render the comment tool.
Note you can also provide your own button to this component.

```jsx
<VeltCommentTool>
  <button slot="button">
    {/* your custom button (optional) */}
  </button>
</VeltCommentTool>
```

### 5c. Place the `VeltCommentPlayerTimeline` component as a sibling to your video player.

To show comment bubbles on your player seek bar, add the `<VeltCommentPlayerTimeline>` component as a sibling to your video player component.

It will auto adjust to the same width as your video player.

```jsx
<div>
  <YourVideoPlayer/>
  <VeltCommentPlayerTimeline/>
</div>
```

<Info>
Right now we assume you have a maximum of one `<VeltCommentPlayerTimeline>` component and one sibling video player component per `documentID`
</Info>

<Warning>
Ensure that the parent container of `<VeltCommentPlayerTimeline>` doesnt have CSS position value as 'static'.
</Warning>

### 5d. Add the `<VeltCommentsSidebar>` component.
(Optional) To embed the sidebar in your existing component, set `embedMode` prop as `true`.

```jsx
<VeltCommentsSidebar embedMode={true}/>
```

### 5e. Add the `<VeltSidebarButton>` component.
This will open or close the Comment Sidebar.
Note you can also provide your own button to this component.

```jsx
<VeltSidebarButton>
  <div className='sidebar-custom-btn'>
    {/* your custom button (optional) */}
  </div>
</VeltSidebarButton>
```


</Step>


<Step title="Set the `totalMediaLength` on the `VeltCommentPlayerTimeline`">
You can pass an integer to `totalMediaLength` using props to represent the total number of frames or seconds in the video:

```jsx
<VeltCommentPlayerTimeline totalMediaLength={120} />
```

Alternatively, you can set this using API method call. This is useful if you first need to grab the total frames from another method before setting it.

```jsx
const commentElement = client.getCommentElement();
commentElement.setTotalMediaLength(120);
```

</Step>

<Step title="Subscribe to when the Comment Tool is activated by the User.">

Add an event handler on where you originally placed `<VeltCommentTool>` to handle `onCommentModeChange` events.

Use this whenever the user clicks on the comment tool, to pause your player and set a new `Location` in the Velt SDK.

Setting a `Location` in the Velt SDK ensures that the comments are tied to that particular media frame or timestamp. 


```jsx

<VeltCommentTool onCommentModeChange={(mode) => onCommentModeChange(mode)} />

const onCommentModeChange = (mode) => {
    // mode will be `true` if the user has activated the comment tool
    // If the comment tool is active, pause the player and set the "location".
    if (mode) {
        // pause player
        // See step 8 below for details 
        setLocation()
    }
});

```

</Step>


<Step title="Set Velt Location">
You can pass in a key value pair object that represents the current state of your player. If you are using the `VeltCommentPlayerTimeline` component, ensure to set the current rounded frame or second in the special key `currentMediaPosition`.

<Info>`currentMediaPosition` is a protected keyword that is used to arrange the comment bubbles on top of the video player timeline in the correct spot</Info>

```jsx
const setLocation = (client) => {
    
    // set currentMediaPosition property on a Location object to represent the current frame
    let location = {
      currentMediaPosition : 120
    }
    //set the Location using the client
    client.setLocation(location)
    
}
```

</Step>

<Step title="When the player is played, remove Velt `Location` to remove comments from the media.">
Call `removeLocation()` when your player starts playing:

```jsx
const removeLocation = () => {
    //remove the location, so the video player can play without comments appearing in frames
    client.removeLocation()
}
```
</Step>


<Step title="Set your player's state when the user clicks on the comment.">
Add the `onCommentClick` event handler on the `VeltCommentsSidebar` & `VeltCommentPlayerTimeline` components you added earlier.
The event will give you back the `location` object that you had set earlier.

You can use this object to update your player state and also update the SDK's `location` so that we can start rendering the comments associated with that `location`.

### 10a. Handle it on the `VeltCommentsSidebar`:
```jsx
<VeltCommentsSidebar embedMode={true} onSidebarCommentClick={(event) => onSidebarCommentClick(event)} />

const onSideBarCommentClick = (event) => {
    if (event) {
      // Get the location object from the event.
      const { location } = event;
      if (location) {
          // Get the media position where the comment was added.
          const { currentMediaPosition } = location;
          if (currentMediaPosition) {
              // Pause the player.

              // Seek to the given comment media position.

              // Set the Velt Location to the clicked comment location.
              client.setLocation(location);
          }
      }
  }
}
```


### 10b. Handle it on the `VeltCommentPlayerTimeline`:
```jsx
<VeltCommentPlayerTimeline onCommentClick={(event) => onTimelineCommentClick(event)} />

const onTimelineCommentClick = (event) => {
  if (event) {
      // Get the location object from the event.
      const { location } = event;
      if (location) {
          // Get the media position where the comment was added.
          const { currentMediaPosition } = location;
          if (currentMediaPosition) {
              // Pause the player.

              // Seek to the given comment media position.

              // Set the Velt Location to the clicked comment location.
              client.setLocation(location);
          }
      }
  }
}
```

The clicked Comment data will be in the following format:

| property | type | description|
|---|---|---|
| `documentId` | string | The document ID where the comment was added |
| `location` | object | The location where the comment was added |
| `targetElementId` | string | The DOM ID of the target element on which the comment was added |
| `context` | Object | Any context data passed when the comment was added |


</Step>


</Steps>





# Additional Configurations

## Allow comments only on certain elements

Provide a list of element DOM IDs where commenting should be allowed.
Comments will be disabled for all other elements.

```jsx
const commentElement = client.getCommentElement();
commentElement.allowedElementIds(['lottiePlayerContainer']);
```
