<Steps titleSize="h2">
<Step title="Import Comment components">
Import the `VeltComments` component.

```js
import {
  VeltProvider,
  VeltComments,
} from '@veltdev/react';
```
</Step>


<Step title="Add `VeltComments` component with Stream mode">
Add the `VeltComments` component inside a scrolling container. Make it a sibling to the element that contains the content you want to be commented.

In the `VeltComments` component, mark the `streamMode` attribute as `true`. 

Also set the `streamViewContainerId` attribute to the id of the scrolling container.

Stream mode renders all comment dialog boxes in a column on the right side similar to Google Docs. It works well with Text mode, which is enabled by default.

Setting a reference to the container ID helps us position & scroll the comment stream as the user scrolls more robustly.


```js
<VeltProvider apiKey="API_KEY">
  <div id="scrolling-container-id">
    //This element is scrollable
    <div className="target-content">
      //This element contains the content that you want to be commented.
    </div>
    <VeltComments
      streamMode={true}
      streamViewContainerId="scrolling-container-id"
    />
  </div>
</VeltProvider>

```
</Step>
<Step title="Test Integration">
Test it out by adding a comment.

Select any text, a `Comment Tool` button will appear near the highlighted text. 

Click on it to add a comment and see the comment appear in the comment stream.
