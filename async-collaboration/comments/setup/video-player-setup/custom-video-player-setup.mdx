<Steps>
<Step title="Set up Velt Components in your app">
You will be using the following components:
- `Velt Comments`: Renders comments on the DOM.
- `Velt Comment Tool`: Enables or disables adding comments.
- `Velt Reaction Tool`: Enables or disables adding reactions.
- `Velt Comment Player Timeline`: Adds comments bubble over your player seek bar.
- `Velt Comments Sidebar`: Adds a sidebar that shows all comments. Users can also search, filter & navigate to the comments from here.
- `Velt Sidebar Button`: Toggles the sidebar on/off.

### Add the `Velt Comments` component in the root of your app

Add the `Velt Comments` component to the root of your app.

<Tabs>

<Tab title="React / Next.js">
```jsx
<VeltComments />
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Other Frameworks">

```html
<velt-comments></velt-comments>
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Add the `Velt Comment Tool` component wherever you want your render the comment tool.
Note you can also provide your own button to this component.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="React / Next.js">
```jsx
<VeltCommentTool>
  <button>
    {/* your custom button (optional) */}
  </button>
</VeltCommentTool>
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Other Frameworks">
```jsx
<velt-comment-tool>
  <button>
    <!-- your custom button (optional) -->
  </button>
</velt-comment-tool>
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Add the `Velt Reaction Tool` component wherever you want your render the reaction tool.
- Provide the video player ID on which you want the reactions to be added.
- Add an event handler to handle `onReactionToolClick` events.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="React / Next.js">
```jsx
<VeltReactionTool videoPlayerId={videoPlayerId}
  onReactionToolClick={() => onReactionToolClick()}>
</VeltReactionTool>
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Other Frameworks">
```html
<div>
  <velt-reaction-tool video-player-id="videoPlayerId"></velt-reaction-tool>
</div>
```
```js
const reactionToolTag = document.querySelector('velt-reaction-tool');
reactionToolTag.addEventListener('onReactionToolClick', (event) => {
  console.log('reaction tool clicked', event.detail);
});
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Place the `Velt Comment Player Timeline` component as a sibling to your video player.

- To show comment bubbles on your player seek bar, add the `Velt Comment Player Timeline` component as a sibling to your video player component.
- It will auto adjust to the same width as your video player.

<Info>
Right now we assume you have a maximum of one `velt comment player timeline` component and one sibling video player component per `documentID`
</Info>

<Warning>
Ensure that the parent container of `velt comment player timeline` doesnt have CSS position value as 'static'.
</Warning>

<Note>
`videoPlayerId` is optional and helps support multiple players/timelines on the same page.

- If omitted, the timeline shows all comments for the current document (for the active version).
- If provided, the timeline shows only comments whose `location.videoPlayerId` matches the given `videoPlayerId`.

Tip: Use the same id on your player element and when setting `location.videoPlayerId` so the timeline can correctly associate comments with the player.
</Note>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="React / Next.js">
```jsx
<div>
  <YourVideoPlayer id="videoPlayerId"/>
  <VeltCommentPlayerTimeline videoPlayerId="videoPlayerId"/>
</div>
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Other Frameworks">
```jsx
<div>
  <your-video-player id="videoPlayerId"></your-video-player>
  <velt-comment-player-timeline video-player-id="videoPlayerId"></velt-comment-player-timeline>
</div>
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Add `id` to the video player or its parent element.
- If you don't have access to the raw `<video>` player, you can add an `id` to the parent element of the video player.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="React / Next.js">
```jsx
<div id="videoPlayerId">
  <YourVideoPlayer />
  <VeltCommentPlayerTimeline videoPlayerId="videoPlayerId"/>
</div>
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Other Frameworks">
```jsx
<div id="videoPlayerId">
  <your-video-player></your-video-player>
  <velt-comment-player-timeline video-player-id="videoPlayerId"></velt-comment-player-timeline>
</div>
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Add the `Velt Comments Sidebar` component.
(Optional) To embed the sidebar in your existing component, set `embedMode` prop as `true`.
<Tabs>
<Tab title="React / Next.js">
```jsx
<VeltCommentsSidebar embedMode={true}/>
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Other Frameworks">
```jsx
<velt-comments-sidebar embed-mode="true"></velt-comments-sidebar>
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Add the `Velt Sidebar Button` component.
This will open or close the Comment Sidebar.
<Tabs>
<Tab title="React / Next.js">
```jsx
<VeltSidebarButton>
</VeltSidebarButton>
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Other Frameworks">
```jsx
<velt-sidebar-button>
</velt-sidebar-button>
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

</Step>


<Step title="Set the `total media length` on the `Velt Comment Player Timeline`">
You can pass an integer to `total media length` using props to represent the total number of frames or seconds in the video:
<Tabs>
<Tab title="React / Next.js">
```jsx
<VeltCommentPlayerTimeline videoPlayerId="videoPlayerId" totalMediaLength={120} />
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Other Frameworks">
```jsx
<velt-comment-player-timeline video-player-id="videoPlayerId" total-media-length="120"></velt-comment-player-timeline>
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
Alternatively, you can set this using API method call.
This is useful if you first need to grab the total frames from another method before setting it.
<Tabs>
<Tab title="React / Next.js">
```jsx
const commentElement = client.getCommentElement();
commentElement.setTotalMediaLength(120);
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Other Frameworks">
```jsx
const commentElement = Velt.getCommentElement();
commentElement.setTotalMediaLength(120);
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

</Step>

<Step title="Detect Comment Tool Activation and Set Media Location">

- Detect when the user activates the comment tool by adding an event handler to the `onCommentModeChange` event.
- Pause your player and set a new `Location` in the Velt SDK.
- This ensures that the comments are tied to that particular media frame or timestamp. 
- You can pass in a key value pair object that represents the current state of your player. 

If you are using the `Velt Comment Player Timeline` component, ensure to set the current rounded frame or second in the special key `currentMediaPosition`.
<Info>`currentMediaPosition` is a protected keyword that is used to arrange the comment bubbles on top of the video player timeline in the correct spot</Info>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="React / Next.js">
```jsx
<VeltCommentTool onCommentModeChange={(mode) => onCommentModeChange(mode)} />

const onCommentModeChange = (mode) => {
    // mode will be `true` if the user has activated the comment tool
    // If the comment tool is active, pause the player and set the "location".
    if (mode) {
        // pause player
        setLocation()
    }
});

const setLocation = (client) => {
    
    // set currentMediaPosition property on a Location object to represent the current frame
    let location = {
      currentMediaPosition : 120,
      videoPlayerId : "videoPlayerId"
    }
    //set the Location using the client
    client.setLocation(location)
    
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Other Frameworks">
```jsx
const commentElement = Velt.getCommentElement();
let subscription = commentElement.onCommentModeChange().subscribe((mode) => {
    // mode will be `true` if the user has activated the comment tool
    // If the comment tool is active, pause the player and set the "location".
    if (mode) {
        // pause player
        setLocation()
    }
});

const setLocation = (client) => {
  // set currentMediaPosition property on a Location object to represent the current frame
  let location = {
    currentMediaPosition : 120,
    videoPlayerId : "videoPlayerId"
  }
  //set the Location using the client
  Velt.setLocation(location)
}
```

To unsubscribe from the subscription:
```jsx
subscription?.unsubscribe()
```

<Step title="Detect Reaction Tool Activation and Set Media Location">

- Detect when the user activates the reaction tool by adding an event handler to the `onReactionToolClick` event.
- Pause your player and set a new `Location` in the Velt SDK.
- This ensures that the reactions are tied to that particular media frame or timestamp. 
- You can pass in a key value pair object that represents the current state of your player.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="React / Next.js">
```jsx

<VeltReactionTool videoPlayerId={videoPlayerId}
  onReactionToolClick={() => onReactionToolClick()}>
</VeltReactionTool>

const onReactionToolClick = () => {
    // pause player
    setLocation()
});

const setLocation = () => {
    // set currentMediaPosition property on a Location object to represent the current frame
    let location = {

</Tab>
<Tab title="Other Frameworks">
```jsx
<velt-reaction-tool video-player-id="videoPlayerId"></velt-reaction-tool>

const reactionToolTag = document.querySelector('velt-reaction-tool');
reactionToolTag.addEventListener('onReactionToolClick', (event) => {
    console.log('reaction tool clicked', event.detail);
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
</Step>

<Step title="When the player is played, remove Velt `Location` to remove comments from the media.">
Call `removeLocation()` when your player starts playing:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="React / Next.js">
```jsx
const removeLocation = () => {
    //remove the location, so the video player can play without comments appearing in frames
    client.removeLocation()
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Other Frameworks">
```jsx
const removeLocation = () => {
    //remove the location, so the video player can play without comments appearing in frames
    Velt.removeLocation()
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
</Step>


<Step title="Navigate to the comment's location in the player from the Sidebar or Timeline.">
Add the `onCommentClick` event handler on the `Velt Comments Sidebar` & `Velt Comment Player Timeline` components you added earlier.
The event will give you back the `location` object that you had set on the comment.

Use this object to:
- update your player state
- update the SDK's `location` so the comments associated with that `location` are rendered.

### Handle click on the `Velt Comments Sidebar`:
<Tabs>
<Tab title="React / Next.js">
```jsx
<VeltCommentsSidebar embedMode={true} onCommentClick={(event) => onCommentClick(event)} />

const onCommentClick = (event) => {
    if (event) {
      // Get the location object from the event.
      const { location } = event;
      if (location) {
          // Get the media position where the comment was added.
          const { currentMediaPosition } = location;
          if (currentMediaPosition) {
              // Pause the player.

              // Seek to the given comment media position.

              // Set the Velt Location to the clicked comment location.
              client.setLocation(location);
          }
      }
  }
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Other Frameworks">
```jsx
const commentElement = document.querySelector('velt-comments-sidebar');
commentElement.addEventListener('onCommentClick', onCommentClick);

// event handler for when a comment is clicked on 
const onCommentClick = (event) => {
  if (event) {
    // Get the location object from the event.
    const { location } = event;
    if (location) {
      // Get the media position where the comment was added.
      const { currentMediaPosition } = location;
      if (currentMediaPosition) {
        // Pause the player.

        // Seek to the given comment media position.

        // Set the Velt Location to the clicked comment location.
        client.setLocation(location);
      }
    }
  }
};

```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Handle click on the `Velt Comment Player Timeline`:
<Tabs>
<Tab title="React / Next.js">
```jsx
<VeltCommentPlayerTimeline videoPlayerId="videoPlayerId" onCommentClick={(event) => onTimelineCommentClick(event)} />

const onTimelineCommentClick = (event) => {
  if (event) {
      // Get the location object from the event.
      const { location } = event;
      if (location) {
          // Get the media position where the comment was added.
          const { currentMediaPosition } = location;
          if (currentMediaPosition) {
              // Pause the player.

              // Seek to the given comment media position.

              // Set the Velt Location to the clicked comment location.
              client.setLocation(location);
          }
      }
  }
}
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Other Frameworks">
```js
const playerTimelineElement = document.querySelector('velt-comment-player-timeline');
if (playerTimelineElement) {
  playerTimelineElement.addEventListener('onCommentClick', (event) => {
    console.log("onCommentClick: ", event.detail);
  });
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

The clicked Comment data will be in the following format:

| property | type | description|
|---|---|---|
| `documentId` | string | The document ID where the comment was added |
| `location` | object | The location where the comment was added |
| `targetElementId` | string | The DOM ID of the target element on which the comment was added |
| `context` | Object | Any context data passed when the comment was added |


</Step>


</Steps>

{/* # Additional Configurations

## Allow comments only on certain elements

Provide a list of element DOM IDs where commenting should be allowed.
Comments will be disabled for all other elements.

```jsx
const commentElement = client.getCommentElement();
commentElement.allowedElementIds(['custom-video-player-container']);
``` */}
