title: Variants
---
- Define variants for the entire Comment Composer component. This will enable you to show different Composer UI in different parts of your app.
- Alternatively, define a variant for the Comment Dialog component and use it here. This will enable you to show different Comment Dialog UI on the DOM vs here.
- Learn more about how to define and use variants [here](/advanced-customization/variants).
