The Comment Standalone Composer enables you to add comments anywhere in your application. It's designed to work seamlessly with other Velt components and APIs:

- [Comment Data APIs](/async-collaboration/comments/customize-behavior#getcommentannotations): Fetch and submit comment data.
- [Comment Thread](/async-collaboration/comments/standalone-components/comment-thread/overview): Render comment threads using fetched data.
- [Comment Pin](/async-collaboration/comments/standalone-components/comment-pin/overview): Display and position comment pins based on fetched data.
- [Comment Dialog Primitives](/ui-customization/features/async/comments/comment-dialog-primitives/overview): Use 115+ granular components for maximum customization flexibility.

By combining these components, you can create custom comment interfaces such as sidebars, overlays, popovers, or inline comments. This approach offers greater flexibility and control over your comment system's design and functionality.
