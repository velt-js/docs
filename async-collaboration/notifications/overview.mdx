By default, the in-app notifications component is connected to Velt's Comments feature. All relevant comment notifications automatically show up here.

You can also add custom notifications from your app into Velt's notifications feature using REST APIs. [Learn more about adding notifications via REST API →](/api-reference/rest-apis/v2/notifications/add-notifications)

In-app notifications are only generated and fetched for documents the user has access to.

## Default Configuration

**Max count:**
- **"For You" tab**: By default, only the latest 50 notifications are fetched. This is done to reduce clutter and noise.
- **"Document" and "All" tabs**: By default, up to 15 notifications are fetched for each of the 15 most recently active documents accessible to the current user. This highlights the most relevant and recent activity.

**Max days:** By default, notifications older than 15 days will not be fetched. This is configurable.

## Components

There are two components associated with the In-app Notifications feature:

- **Velt Notifications Tool**: This opens the Notifications Panel.
- **Velt Notifications Panel**: This shows all the Notifications grouped in categories.
