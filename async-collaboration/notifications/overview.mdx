There are two components associated with In-app Notifications feature:
- `Velt Notifications Tool`: This opens the Notifications Panel.
- `Velt Notifications Panel`: This shows all the `Notifications` grouped in categories.

## Access Control Integration

Notifications in "For You" and "Documents" tabs now only show for documents the user has access to. This ensures users only receive notifications for accessible content and prevents email notifications for inaccessible documents. This behavior also applies when using [Permission Provider](/key-concepts/overview#1-on-demand-permissions) to manage access control.

When using REST APIs to create notifications, you can enable the `verifyUserPermissions` flag in the [`Add Notifications`](/api-reference/rest-apis/v2/notifications/add-notifications) and [`Update Notifications`](/api-reference/rest-apis/v2/notifications/update-notifications) APIs to enforce access checks during notification creation.

Default config:
- Max count:
  - "For You" tab: By default only the latest 50 notifications are fetched. This is done to reduce clutter and noise.
  - "Document" and "All" tabs: By default, up to 15 notifications are fetched for each of the 15 most recently active documents accessible to the current user. This highlights the most relevant and recent activity.
- Max days: By default, notifications older than 15 days will not be fetched. This is configurable.
