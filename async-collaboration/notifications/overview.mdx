There are two components associated with In-app Notifications feature:
- `Velt Notifications Tool`: This opens the Notifications Panel.
- `Velt Notifications Panel`: This shows all the `Notifications` grouped in categories.

Default config:
- Max count:
  - "For You" tab: By default only the latest 50 notifications are fetched. This is done to reduce clutter and noise.
  - "Document" and "All" tabs: By default, up to 15 notifications are fetched for each of the 15 most recently active documents accessible to the current user. This highlights the most relevant and recent activity.
- Max days: By default, notifications older than 15 days will not be fetched. This is configurable.
