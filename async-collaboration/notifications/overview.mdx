There are two components associated with In-app Notifications feature:
- `Velt Notifications Tool`: This opens the Notifications Panel.
- `Velt Notifications Panel`: This shows all the `Notifications` grouped in categories.

Default config:
- Max count: By default only the first 50 notifications for each document are fetched. This is done to reduce clutter and noise.
- Max days: By default, notifications older than 15 days will not be fetched. This is configurable.
