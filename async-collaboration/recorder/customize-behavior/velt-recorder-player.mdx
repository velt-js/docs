## 3. onDelete callback
<Tabs>
<Tab title="React / Next.js">
The creator of the recordings will see an option to delete the recording after it has been recorded. Once the user deletes the recording, the `VeltRecorderPlayer` component will emit an event called `onDelete` with the recorder ID. You can listen to the callback and use the response object to perform any clean up on your end. 

This is the response object that you get back:

| Field    | Type                          | Example       |
| -------- | ------------------------------| --------------|
| id       | string                        | "recorder_id" |

```js
<VeltRecorderPlayer recorderId={RECORDER_ID} onDelete={(data) => yourDeleteMethod(data)} />
```
</Tab>
