## Advanced Set Up options

This section includes a list of optional advanced set up options.

## Location

Users logged into the same **Document** ID can see each other's `Presence`, `Cursors`, `Comments` etc. 

However, if you want to add another layer of categorization to organize users together, you can use **Location**.

<Tip> If a **Document** is like a house, a **Location** is like a room within the house. </Tip>

To learn more about `Locations`, check out its dedicated section [here](/key-concepts/overview#locations).

## Contacts

When you reply to a comment, you can `@mention` other teammates that are added to a `User's Contacts List`.

To learn more about creating a `User's Contacts List`, [read here](/key-concepts/users/contact-list).


## Detect if Velt SDK is initialized

This returns true when both the Velt User and Document are initialized:


```jsx
let subscription = client.getVeltInitState().subscribe((veltInitState: boolean | undefined) => {
	console.log('Velt Init State:', veltInitState);
});
```

To unsubscribe from the subscription:
```jsx
subscription?.unsubscribe()
```

You can also the use `useVeltInitState()` hook:

```jsx
import { useVeltInitState } from '@veltdev/react';

function YourComponent() {
    const veltInitState = useVeltInitState();
    useEffect(() => {
        console.log('Velt Init State:', veltInitState);
        if (veltInitState) {
            // Velt state is initialized, so user can perform any action here
        }
    }, [veltInitState]);
}

```
