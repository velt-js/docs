Get better results from AI coding agents when building with Velt. Agent Skills are structured knowledge packages that teach your AI agent the correct Velt patterns, so it writes working code on the first try instead of guessing from outdated training data.

<Info>
Agent Skills follow the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) format and work with Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and other AI coding agents that support skill discovery.

## What Are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills are folders of instructions, rules, and code examples that AI agents can discover and reference while helping you write code. Each skill covers a specific area of the Velt SDK and contains prioritized rules with correct and incorrect code patterns, verification checklists, and source pointers back to the official docs.

Instead of relying on the agent's general training data (which may be outdated or incomplete), skills give the agent access to verified, up-to-date Velt implementation patterns.

## When to Use Skills

Install Agent Skills when you are:

- Setting up Velt in a new project for the first time
- Adding collaborative commenting to a React, Next.js, or web application
- Integrating real-time collaborative editing with CRDT (Yjs) and editors like Tiptap, BlockNote, or CodeMirror
- Implementing in-app notifications, email delivery, or webhook integrations
- Debugging issues with Velt features and looking for correct patterns

## Installation

Install all available Velt skills with a single command:

```bash
npx skills add velt-js/agent-skills
```

Skills are automatically available once installed. Your AI agent will use them when relevant tasks are detected.

## Available Skills

The repository contains four skills covering the core areas of the Velt SDK:

</Card>

</CardGroup>

## How Skills Are Organized

Each skill follows a consistent structure:

```
skills/{skill-name}/
  SKILL.md              # Agent-facing manifest (when to apply, category index)
  AGENTS.md             # Generated compressed index of all rules
  AGENTS.full.md        # Generated verbose guide with all rules expanded
  README.md             # Contributor guide
  metadata.json         # Version, organization, and metadata
  rules/
    _sections.md        # Section definitions and ordering
    _template.md        # Template for new rules
    shared/             # Framework-agnostic rules
    react/              # React / Next.js specific rules
    non-react/          # Non-React specific rules
```

Rules are organized into **category folders** (e.g., `core/`, `panel/`, `data/`) within framework groups (`shared/`, `react/`, `non-react/`). Each rule file is named `{prefix}-{descriptive-name}.md` where the prefix matches its category.

## How to Pick the Right Skill

| You want to... | Use this skill |
| --- | --- |
| Set up Velt for the first time | `velt-setup-best-practices` |
| Add comments (any mode or editor) | `velt-comments-best-practices` |
| Add real-time collaborative editing (CRDT/Yjs) | `velt-crdt-best-practices` |
| Add notifications or email delivery | `velt-notifications-best-practices` |

## Example Prompts

Once skills are installed, you can give your AI agent prompts like these. The agent will automatically reference the relevant skill rules.

**Setting up Velt in a new project:**

```
Set up Velt collaboration in my Next.js app. I need comments and presence.
My API key is in .env.local as NEXT_PUBLIC_VELT_API_KEY.
```

**Adding CRDT collaborative editing:**

```
Set up Velt CRDT for my Tiptap editor. The document ID comes from
the route parameter. Ask me for any identifiers you need.
```

**Debugging an integration issue:**

```
Help me debug why my collaborative cursors aren't showing.
Check the Velt skills for correct setup patterns before suggesting fixes.
```

## Rule Priority Levels

Each rule in a skill is assigned an impact level so the agent knows what matters most:

| Level | Improvement | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CRITICAL** | Prevents failure or 10-100x improvement | Provider setup, authentication, core initialization |
| **HIGH** | Major quality gain (5-20x) | Comment modes, CRDT editor integration |
| **MEDIUM-HIGH** | Significant benefit (2-5x) | Standalone components, design patterns |
| **MEDIUM** | Noticeable gain (1.5-3x) | UI customization, data handling |
| **LOW-MEDIUM** | Minor benefit (1.2-2x) | Configuration, debugging patterns |
| **LOW** | Incremental or edge cases | Advanced techniques, polish |

## Staying Up to Date

Skills are updated as the Velt SDK evolves with new features, API changes, and improved patterns. To pull the latest rules into your project, re-run the install command:

```bash
npx skills add velt-js/agent-skills
```

This will fetch the latest version of all skills, including any new rules or updated code examples.

You can also watch the [agent-skills GitHub repository](https://github.com/velt-js/agent-skills) to get notified when new skills or rules are published. For broader SDK updates and announcements, follow us on [X](https://x.com/veltjs) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/veltjs/).
