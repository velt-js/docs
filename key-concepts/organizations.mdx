## Create an Organization

### Client side
When the user signs into an organization as described below,
if an organization is not present then it will be created automatically.

### Server side
Using our REST APIs, you will be able to create an organization and also set metadata like name, description, etc.

## Provision Access to an Organization
You can provision access to an organization using [this](/key-concepts/access-control)

## Sign in User into an Organization
- In the [identify()](/get-started/setup/authenticate) method, set the `organizationId` and also add it to the [auth token](/security/jwt-tokens).
- If you want the user to log into another organization, call the identify method again with the new organizationId and new auth token.
