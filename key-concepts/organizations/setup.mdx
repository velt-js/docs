### Create an Organization

#### Client side
When the user signs into an organization as described below,
if an organization is not present then it will be created automatically.

#### Server side
Using our REST APIs, you will be able to create an organization and also set metadata like name, description, etc.

### Add or Remove Users to an Organization to provision access
- You will need to explicitly [add](/rest-apis/users/add-users) or [delete](/rest-apis/users/delete-users) users from the organization to provision or revoke access.
- As users are added or removed in your app, you can use our API to sync that information on Velt as well.
- Learn more about [User Management](/rest-apis/users/add-users).

<Warning> If users are not added to the Organization, they will not be able to access the data inside it.</Warning>

### Sign in User into an Organization
- In the [identify()](/get-started/setup/authenticate) method, set the `organizationId` and also add it to the [auth token](/security/jwt-tokens).
- If you want the user to log into another organization, call the identify method again with the new organizationId and new auth token.

### Access Controls for Organizations
You can set up granular access controls for users within an organization. Learn more [here](/key-concepts/access-control/overview).
