Velt is a collaboration SDK that helps you add pre-built collaboration features to your product. To model your application's data structure and manage access control, Velt provides various structural entities:

```Organization -> Folders -> Documents -> Locations```

- **Organizations**: Map to your customer's account/workspace.
- **Folders**: Group related content (projects, categories, etc.).
- **Documents**: Represent your app's collaborative content.
- **Locations**: Target specific parts of your content.

<Info>
For example, if you're building:
- **Video Editor**: Org (customer) → Folders (projects) → Documents (videos) → Locations (timestamps)
- **Dashboard Tool**: Org (customer) → Folders (departments) → Documents (dashboards) → Locations (filters)
- **Website Builder**: Org (customer) → Documents (sites) → Locations (pages)
</Info>

## Organizations

An **Organization** typically represents your customer's company workspace:
- Maps to your application's account/tenant structure.
- Controls global access permissions.
- Contains folders, documents, locations, and users.
- Access Control: You can set default access type for all folders and documents.

<Info>When building a SaaS application, map each of your customer's accounts to a Velt organization. This aligns collaboration permissions with your existing access control.</Info>

## Folders

**Folders** help your users organize their collaborative content.
- These are **optional**.
- Mirrors your app's existing content structure and enables logical grouping of "documents".
- Contains documents, other folders and users.
- Documents can be added to a single folder only.
- Access Control: Provides granular access control. Can have `organizationPrivate`, `public`, `restricted` access types.

Example folder structure for a video editing app:
```
customer_account (org)
  ├── marketing_videos (folder)
  │   ├── product_launch.mp4 (document)
  │   └── tutorial_series.mp4 (document)
  └── internal_videos (folder)
      ├── team_updates.mp4 (document)
      └── training.mp4 (document)
```

## Documents

A **Document** represents a single collaborative space in your application.
- Maps to your app's primary content (video, dashboard, page, etc.).
- Enables real-time interaction between users.
- Contains all collaboration data, locations and users.
- Access Control: Provides granular access control. Can have `organizationPrivate`, `public`, `restricted` access types.

Example mappings:
```
Video Editor    → Each video is a document
Dashboard Tool  → Each dashboard is a document
Website Builder → Each site is a document
Design Tool     → Each canvas is a document
```

<Info>Map documents to whatever represents a collaborative unit in your application. Users viewing the same document will see each other's presence, cursors, comments, and other collaborative features.</Info>

## Locations

**Locations** represent collaborative sub-sections of your content.
- Maps logical segments in your content.
- This is **optional** and can be used to organize collaboration data futher to suit your app's needs.

Common Location examples:
```
Video Editor    → Timestamps in the video
Dashboard Tool  → Different filter combinations
Website Builder → Pages in a site
Spreadsheet     → Different filter combinations
```

<Tip>Use locations when you want further partition collaboration data (comments, presence, etc.) to certain parts of your content rather than the entire document.</Tip>

## Users

A **User** in Velt represents a participant in your application's collaborative features.
- Integrate with your app's existing authentication system.
- Inherit your existing permission structure.


### User Types

Velt's user system is designed with hierarchical access control, supporting different user types based on their scope and permissions. Here's a breakdown of each user type:

**1. Organization Users**

**Properties:**
- Highest level access scope (organization-wide).
- Full access to all Velt data within their organization. Can be changed using [Access Control](/key-concepts/access-control) features.
- Complete visibility of @mentions list of the organization.
- Can be assigned to groups/teams.

**Use when:** Always. If you have a concept of workspaces or groups of customers, map each workspace to an Organization.


**2. Folder Users**

**Properties:**
- Folder-level access scope.
- Access to all folders and documents within assigned folders.
- Mutual visibility in @mentions with other folder users.

**Use when:** Implementing project-based or department-based access control.


**3. Document Users**

**Properties:**
- Document-level access scope.
- Access limited to specific documents.
- Mutual visibility in @mentions within document context.

**Use when:** Implementing document-specific collaboration or restricting access to specific documents.


**4. Guest Users**

**Properties:**
- Document-specific access only for the document that has `public` access type.
- No organization-level visibility.
- Can be anonymous.

**Use when:** Implementing deal rooms, public feedback etc that can be shared with anyone.

**5. Admin Users**

You can assign some users as `admin`. Admin users can get special privileges like deleting others comments.

**Use when:** Giving special privileges to some users to moderate comments etc within the app.

### @mentions
The `@mention` feature lets users tag others in documents. The contact list includes:
- Organization, folder, and document users
- User Groups
- `@here`: A special group that includes only users explicitly added to the document

Key features:
- The contact list automatically updates when users are added or removed from the organization, folder, document, or user groups.
- Access control features let you manage which users are visible in the contact list on a given document.
- You can also override the contact list using the [contacts API](/async-collaboration/comments/customize-behavior#updatecontactlist).

### User Groups
![](/images/key-concepts/mentions-groups.png)

If your application has a concept of user groups, you can replicate that in Velt.
**User Groups** let you create custom collections of users (such as engineering, marketing, etc.) to group organization users and manage access effectively. They:
- Enable @mentioning a team group versus just individuals (similar to Slack)
- Can be used to provision access to folders and documents
- Users can belong to multiple groups
- Cannot include non-organization users

## Access Control
![](/images/key-concepts/document-access.png)

**Access types:**
- **`public`** (default): Any user who logs into the given folder or document can access it, regardless of organization membership.
- **`organizationPrivate`**: Only organization users have access to the folder or document.
- **`restricted`**: Only users explicitly added to the folder or document have access (even organization users not explicitly added will not have access).

**Access type can be configured at:**
1. Organization Level: Set default access type for all folders and documents.
2. Folder Level: Set access type for a folder and all its contents.
3. Document Level: Set access type for a specific document.


**Key features:**
- Folders and documents inherit access type from the parent. Root folders and documents inherit the organization's access type.
- Folder-level access overrides organization-level access. Document in the folder inherits the folder's access type.
- Document-level access overrides organization-level access only if it is not inside a folder. 
- Access can be granted or revoked by adding/removing users from a organization, folder or document.
