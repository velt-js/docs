## Contact List
When the user is on a document, they can `@mention` other users. By default, the contact list for the `@mention` feature includes users from:

- Organization users.
- Folder users.
- Document users.
- User Groups.
- `@here`: This is a special group that includes only the users explicitly added on the document. This doesn't include organization users or organization user groups.

**Contact list is automatically updated:**
- as users are [added](/api-reference/rest-apis/v2/users/add-users) or [deleted](/api-reference/rest-apis/v2/users/delete-users) from the organization, folder or the document.
- users are [added](/api-reference/rest-apis/v2/user-groups/add-users-to-group) or [deleted](/api-reference/rest-apis/v2/user-groups/delete-users-from-group) from user groups.
- user groups are [added](/api-reference/rest-apis/v2/user-groups/add-groups) or updated.

<Info>
**Access Control:**
Using the access control features, you can control which users are visible on the contact list on a given document.
- Organization users can access the entire Organization contact list on a given organization document.
- Guest (Non-organization) users who were granted access to an organization document cannot access the Organization contact list. If you want to show some organization contacts to these guest users, then you need to explicitly add them to the document.

## User Groups
![](/images/key-concepts/mentions-groups.png)
You can create custom collection of users such as engineering, marketing etc to group organization users and manage access effectively.
- This can be used to @mention a team group versus just individuals (just like in Slack).
- This can also be used to provision access to documents. (coming soon)
- Organization users can belong to multiple organization user groups.
- Non-organization users can't be part of organization user groups.

## Sign in a User
To sign in a user call the `identify()` method with the `userId` and `authToken` as described [here](get-started/setup/authenticate).

<Tip>Even though using JWT Auth token is optional, we recommend using it for additional security.</Tip>

Once a `User` has been authenticated, their profile can be seen within Velt's collaboration features.

For example in the Comments feature, the User's name is shown by their comment and in `@mentions`.

Additionally in the Presence and in Cursors features, the User's name is shown by their avatar bubble and mouse cursors.


## Sign in with force reset
By default when you identify a **User**, we maintain the user auth in the browser unless you explicitly sign out the logged in user.

If you are changing a User's access or any metadata and want those changes to be reflected immediately,
then you should re-call the `identify` method with `forceReset` option set to `true`.

Learn more [here](/key-concepts/authentication#force-re-login-user).


## Sign out a User
In a given session or browser tab, if you want to switch users, 
you need to first signout the current user and then sign in using `identify` method again.
This will ensure we clean up the current user session and start a new session with the new user.

```jsx
client.signOutUser();
```
