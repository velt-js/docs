### Overview
When the user is on a document, they can `@mention` other users. By default, the contact list for the `@mention` feature includes users from:

- Organization users.
- Guest users explicitly added to the current document.
- Organization User Groups.
- `@here`: This is a special group that includes only the users explicitly added on the document. This doesn't include organization users or organization user groups.

**Contact list is automatically updated:**
- as users are [added](/rest-apis/users/add-users) or [deleted](/rest-apis/users/delete-users) from the organization or the document.
- users are [added](/rest-apis/organization-user-groups/add-users-to-group) or [deleted](/rest-apis/organization-user-groups/delete-users-from-group) from organization user groups.
- organization user groups are [added](/rest-apis/organization-user-groups/add-groups) or updated.

**Access Control:**
Using the access control features, you can control which users are visible on the contact list on a given document.
- Organization users can access the entire Organization contact list on a given organization document.
- Guest (Non-organization) users who were granted access to an organization document cannot access the Organization contact list. If you want to show some organization contacts to these guest users, then you need to explicitly add them to the document.
