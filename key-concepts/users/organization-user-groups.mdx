### Overview
![](/images/key-concepts/mentions-groups.png)
You can create custom collection of users such as engineering, marketing etc to group organization users and manage access effectively.
- This can be used to @mention a team group versus just individuals (just like in Slack).
- This can also be used to provision access to documents. (coming soon)
- Organization users can belong to multiple organization user groups.
- Non-organization users can't be part of organization user groups.
