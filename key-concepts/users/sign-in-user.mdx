To sign in a user call the `identify()` method with the `userId` and `authToken` as described [here](get-started/setup/authenticate).

<Tip>Even though using JWT Auth token is optional, we recommend using it for additional security.</Tip>

Once a `User` has been authenticated, their profile can be seen within Velt's collaboration features.

For example in the Comments feature, the User's name is shown by their comment and in `@mentions`.

Additionally in the Presence and in Cursors features, the User's name is shown by their avatar bubble and mouse cursors.


### Sign in with force reset
By default when you identify a **User**, we maintain the user auth in the browser unless you explicitly sign out the logged in user.

If you are changing a User's access or any metadata and want those changes to be reflected immediately,
then you should re-call the `identify` method with `forceReset` option set to `true`.
