Cord has shut down their service. We are providing a migration path for all the Cord users to migrate to Velt.

## Migration Process Overview
- Download the cord data in JSON format using their REST APls. Send it to us using a secure file-sharing system.
- We have an internal service written to transform that data and add it to your Velt account. You need not use our APls for this. We will do it for you.
- It will take about a week for the end-to-end migration process. We can expedite it to be 1-2 days if it's more urgent for you.
- If you prefer, we can also help you migrate over to Velt on production over a weekend so that your customers don't notice any changes.

## Migration Steps
<Steps titleSize="h2">
<Step title="Step 1: Provide Test Account Access">
Give us access to a test account in your app where Cord is implemented. It should contain some cord comments.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 2: Export Test Data">
Export the Cord data from the above test account and send it to us. [Learn more](https://docs.velt.dev/migration/cord-migration/export-cord-data-for-migration)
</Step>
<Step title="Step 3: Sample Migration">
We will migrate that small sample first and verify it with you.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 4: Full Data Export">
Once everything looks good, you will send all of the Cord data as JSON files. We will do a test run on the entire dataset.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 5: Schedule Migration">
Schedule a migration date: On this date, all your cord production data (as of this date) with Velt implemented in your app will go live.
