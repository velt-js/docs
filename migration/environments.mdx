Velt provides robust environment management capabilities to help you separate your production, staging, and development workflows while maintaining complete data isolation and independent configurations.

## Environment separation

Each environment in Velt is completely isolated through API keys. This ensures that your production data never mixes with staging or development data, and allows you to configure each environment independently based on your specific needs.

### Production environments

<Info>
When you upgrade your account to production, you automatically receive a new production API key.
</Info>

Upon upgrading to a production plan, Velt automatically generates a dedicated production API key for you. This key is separate from your development keys and comes with production-level features and support.

#### Regional API keys for enterprise

<Tip>
Enterprise customers can create multiple production API keys for different geographic regions to optimize performance and comply with data residency requirements.
</Tip>

Enterprise customers have the flexibility to create separate production API keys for different regions, such as:

- **North America (NA)** - For US and Canadian users
- **European Union (EU)** - For EU-based users with GDPR compliance requirements
- **Other regions** - Based on your specific geographic needs

This regional separation helps you:
- Reduce latency by serving users from geographically closer servers
- Meet data residency and compliance requirements
- Optimize performance for distributed teams

### Staging and development environments

For staging and development purposes, you can create up to **10 API keys** per account. This allows you to:

- Set up multiple staging environments for different features or teams
- Create separate development environments for each developer
- Test different configurations without affecting production
- Run parallel testing scenarios

<Warning>
Each API key has a limit of 10 keys for non-production environments. Plan your environment structure accordingly.
</Warning>

## Complete environment isolation

Every aspect of your Velt configuration is isolated by API key, ensuring complete separation between environments:

### Isolated by API key

Each environment maintains its own:

- **Data** - Comments, annotations, recordings, and all collaboration data
- **Configurations** - Feature settings, UI customization, and behavior preferences
- **Webhooks** - Webhook endpoints and event subscriptions
- **Users** - User records and authentication settings
- **Permissions** - Access control rules and user groups
- **Settings** - All workspace and feature-specific settings

<Note>
Think of each API key as a completely separate workspace with its own isolated ecosystem.
</Note>

### Manual configuration required

<Warning>
Settings and configurations do not automatically sync between environments. You must manually configure each environment.
</Warning>

When setting up a new environment, you'll need to manually replicate:

1. **Feature configurations** - Enable and configure features for each environment
2. **UI customization** - Apply styling and layout preferences
3. **Webhook endpoints** - Set up webhook URLs for each environment
4. **User permissions** - Define access control rules
5. **Integration settings** - Configure third-party integrations

This manual approach ensures you have full control over what gets deployed to each environment and prevents accidental configuration changes from affecting production.

## Best practices

### Step 1: Plan your environment structure

Before creating API keys, map out your environment needs:
- How many staging environments do you need?
- Do developers need individual development environments?
- Will you need region-specific production keys?

### Step 2: Use consistent naming conventions

Name your API keys clearly to identify their purpose:
- `production-na`, `production-eu` for regional production keys
- `staging-main`, `staging-feature-x` for different staging environments
- `dev-john`, `dev-sarah` for developer-specific environments

### Step 3: Document your configurations

Keep a record of critical settings for each environment to make replication easier:
- Feature flags and their states
- Custom webhook endpoints
- UI customization choices
- Permission structures

### Step 4: Test configuration changes in staging first

Always test significant configuration changes in staging before applying them to production:

<Check>
Verify the changes work as expected in a safe environment before affecting your users.
</Check>

## Creating and managing API keys

You can create and manage your API keys through the [Velt Console](https://console.velt.dev/):

1. Navigate to your workspace settings
2. Go to the API Keys section
3. Click "Create New API Key"
4. Provide a descriptive name for your environment
5. Select the appropriate environment type (production, staging, or development)

<Tip>
Store your API keys securely using environment variables or a secrets management service. Never commit API keys to version control.
</Tip>

## Upgrading from development to production

When you're ready to move from development to production:

### Step 1: Upgrade your plan

Choose the production plan that fits your needs in the Velt Console.

<Info>
Your new production API key will be automatically generated upon upgrade.
</Info>

### Step 2: Manually configure your production environment

Replicate the configurations from your staging environment:
- Feature settings
- UI customization
- Webhook endpoints
- User permissions

### Step 3: Update your application

Replace the development API key in your production application with the new production API key.

<Warning>
Ensure you update all instances where the API key is used, including environment variables and configuration files.
</Warning>

### Step 4: Test thoroughly

Verify that all features work correctly with the production API key before directing user traffic.

<Check>
Your production environment is now live and isolated from development/staging environments.
