---

Each API key in Velt represents a separate environment with completely isolated data and settings.

## Environment types

### Production

When you upgrade to a production plan, you receive a production API key.

#### Setup in 4 quick steps

##### **1. Upgrade your plan**

Select a production plan in the Velt Console. A production API key is generated automatically.

##### **2. Configure production environment**

Manually replicate your staging configurations:
- Feature settings
- UI customization
- Webhooks
- Permissions

##### **3. Update your application**

Replace the development API key with your production API key in all locations.

<Warning>
Update environment variables, config files, and any hardcoded references.
</Warning>

##### **4. Test**

Verify all features work with the production API key before going live.

**Regional keys (Enterprise only)**

Enterprise customers can create production API keys for specific regions to reduce latency and meet data residency requirements. See [Supported Regions](/security/supported-regions) for all available regions.

Example use cases:
- North America key for US/Canadian users
- EU key for GDPR compliance
- Additional regional keys as needed

### Staging and development

Create up to **10 API keys** for non-production environments. Use these for:
- Staging environments per team or feature
- Individual developer environments
- Testing and QA

## Data isolation

Each API key has completely separate:
- Data (comments, recordings, etc.)
- Feature configurations
- Webhooks
- Users and permissions
- UI customization

<Warning>
Settings and configurations do not automatically sync between environments. You must manually configure each environment.
</Warning>

## Configuration management

When setting up a new environment, manually replicate these settings:

1. Feature configurations
2. UI customization
3. Webhook endpoints
4. User permissions
5. Integration settings

**Naming convention**

Use clear names to identify each environment:
```
production-na, production-eu
staging-main, staging-feature-x
dev-john, dev-sarah
```

**Configuration tracking**

Document your settings per environment:
- Enabled features
- Webhook URLs
- UI customizations
- Permission rules

<Tip>
Test configuration changes in staging before applying to production.
</Tip>

## Managing API keys

Create and manage keys in the [Velt Console](https://console.velt.dev/):

1. Go to workspace settings
2. Open API Keys section
3. Click "Create New API Key"
4. Name your environment
5. Select environment type

<Warning>
Store API keys in environment variables or a secrets manager. Never commit them to version control.
</Warning>
