title: "Migrate from Cord to Velt"
---

Cord has shut down their service. We are providing a migration path for all the Cord users to migrate to Velt.

## Migration Process Overview
- Download the cord data in JSON format using their REST APIs. Send it to us using a secure file-sharing system.
- We have an internal service written to transform that data and add it to your Velt account. You need not use our APIs for this. We will do it for you.
- It will take about a week for the end-to-end migration process. We can expedite it to be 1-2 days if it's more urgent for you.
- If you prefer, we can also help you migrate over to Velt on production over a weekend so that your customers don't notice any changes.

## Migration Steps
<Steps titleSize="h2">
<Step title="Step 1: Provide Test Account Access">
Give us access to a test account in your app where Cord is implemented. It should contain some cord comments.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 2: Export Test Data">
Export the Cord data from the above test account and send it to us. [Learn more](#exporting-cord-data)
</Step>
<Step title="Step 3: Sample Migration">
We will migrate that small sample first and verify it with you.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 4: Full Data Export">
Once everything looks good, you will send all of the Cord data as JSON files. We will do a test run on the entire dataset.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 5: Schedule Migration">
Schedule a migration date: On this date, all your cord production data (as of this date) with Velt implemented in your app will go live.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Exporting Cord Data
<Warning>
### Note:
- These APIs have pagination built-in and return 1000 entries by default. Either extend the limit or loop over the pages to get all the data.
- Send data pulled from each API in a separate JSON file.
</Warning>

## Comments
Use the following Cord REST APIs to pull all the comments-related data and export it as a JSON file:

• [Threads](https://docs.cord.com/rest-apis/threads)

• [Messages](https://docs.cord.com/rest-apis/messages)

• [Users](https://docs.cord.com/rest-apis/users)

• [Groups](https://docs.cord.com/rest-apis/groups)

## Comment File Attachments
When you pull thread and message data using the above APIs, the file attachment URL is also present in the data. However, those URLs expire. You have two options for migration:

**Option 1**: You can use the URL to download the files and upload them to your cloud. Send us the new file attachment URLs in the following format in a JSON file:

Sample Format:
```jsx
[{
    "documentId": "<ID>",
    "userId": "<ID>",
    "messageId": "<ID>",
    "type": "file",
    "fileData": {
        "id": "<ID>",
        "type": "file",
        "name": "<FILE_NAME>",
        "url": "<URL>",
        "mimeType": "MIME_TYPE",
        "size": 6278949,
        "uploadStatus": "uploaded"
    },
    "fileUrl": "<URL>"
}]
```
**Option 2**: Schedule file migration date with us so you can pull the latest comments data, which will have fresh file access tokens. Then we can download/store it on our end, and update the URLs ourselves.

## Notifications
Given the ephemeral nature of notifications, we don't think you need to migrate them. However, if you do want us to migrate your notifications data, you could use this API to get the notifications data from Cord:
