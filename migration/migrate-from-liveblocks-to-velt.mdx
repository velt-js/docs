title: "Migrate from Liveblocks to Velt"
---

For customers facing limitations with Liveblocks (eg: features, security, pricing, etc.), we provide an easy path to migrate to Velt.

## Migration Process Overview
- Export your Liveblocks data in JSON format using [their REST APIs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-rooms-roomId-threads) and send it to us through a secure file-sharing system.
- You have two options for migration: (1) Transform the data yourself and use [our REST APIs](/api-reference/rest-apis/comments-feature/comment-annotations/add-comment-annotations) to migrate it, or (2) Send us the raw Liveblocks data and we'll handle the transformation and migration for you.
- The complete migration process typically takes about a week or so.
- We can coordinate the production migration over a weekend to ensure zero downtime and a seamless transition for your users.

## Migration Steps
<Steps titleSize="h2">
<Step title="Step 1: Provide Test Account Access">
Provide us with access to a test account in your application where Liveblocks is currently implemented. This test account should contain existing Liveblocks comments and collaboration data for validation purposes.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 2: Export Sample Data">
Export the Liveblocks data from your test account and securely share it with us. This allows us to understand your data structure and perform initial validation. [Learn more](#exporting-liveblocks-data)
</Step>
<Step title="Step 3: Sample Migration & Validation">
We will perform a migration on your sample data and work with you to verify that all comments, user data, and collaboration features have been accurately migrated to Velt.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 4: Full Data Export & Testing">
After successful validation of the test migration, export your complete Liveblocks production dataset as JSON files. We will perform a comprehensive test migration on the full dataset to ensure data integrity.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 5: Production Migration">
Schedule your production migration date. On the agreed date, we will migrate all your Liveblocks production data to Velt and coordinate the go-live process to ensure a seamless transition for your users.
</Step>

## Exporting Liveblocks Data

### Comments
Use the following Liveblocks REST APIs to pull all the comments-related data and export it as a JSON file:

• [Threads](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-rooms-roomId-threads)

• [Comments](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-rooms-roomId-threads-threadId-comments-commentId)


### Users
Use the following Liveblocks REST APIs to pull all the users-related data and export it as a JSON file:

• [Users](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-rooms-roomId-active-users)


### Notifications
Given the ephemeral nature of notifications, we don't think you need to migrate them. However, if you do want us to migrate your notifications data, you could use this API to get the notifications data from Liveblocks:

- [Notifications](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#get-users-userId-inboxNotifications)
