<Step title="Enable Follow Me mode on Presence">
Enable `Follow Me` mode feature.

```js
 <VeltPresence flockMode={true} />
```

You need to add the [Presence feature](/realtime-collaboration/presence/overview) to trigger `Follow Me` mode. This will enable `Follow Me` mode as an option for your users globally, wherever `Presence` is shown.

To start the shared `Follow Me` session, click on a user's avatar to start following them.

</Step>

<Step title="Test Integration">
Test it out by opening the target page in two browsers with two different users logged in.

You should see the avatars of the users rendered where you added the `Presence` component. Now click on any avatar to start following them.
