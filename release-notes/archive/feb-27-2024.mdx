## Comment Thread Component
We've abstacted out the UI we use for the threads in our `Comments`component into its own component. Now you can use our [Comment Thread](/async-collaboration/comment-thread/overview) component with your comment data to create your own custom UIs.

## Update Contact List

The [Contact List](/users/client-side/setup) is the list of emails you see when you try to `@mention` one of your teammates in a comment thread.

We now have two ways for you to keep your users' contact lists up to date. 
- [Server Side](/users/server-side/api-reset-contact-list): Implement updates to your contact lists directly through a server-side API call. This method ensures that your contact lists are always synchronized with the latest data.
- [Client Side](/users/client-side/setup): For more dynamic updates, the client-side `identify()` method can be re-called with a configuration object to reinitialize your logged in users' contact list.


## PDF Viewer Support

We've added support for you to [leave comments on PDF Viewers](/async-collaboration/comments/customize-behavior/general-controls). To enable this, simply add the `data-velt-pdf-viewer` attribute on the element containing your PDF.

```jsx
<!-- Add data-velt-pdf-viewer="true" attribute at container level of your pdf viewer -->
<div id="viewerContainer" data-velt-pdf-viewer="true">
    <!-- Your pdf viewer here -->
    <div id="viewer" class="pdfViewer"></div>
</div>
```
