## Added `updateContactList` Method
We have now added a way to update UserContacts from client using the `client.updateContactList(userContact[])` method. 

a. By default, it will overwrite the current contact list.

b. To merge with the already present contacts, you may use it with the merge flag: `client.updateContactList(userContact[], {merge:true})`. 

This will work for both organization and non-organization structures.
