### New Features

- [**UI Customization**]: Added [Confirm Dialog Wireframe](/ui-customization/features/async/comments/confirm-dialog/overview) and added support for light and dark modes.
  - This is a common UI component used for multiple features like deleting comment thread, deleting a recorded content and more.
