# 3.0.83

<Warning>
  This release changes how users navigate to comments from the sidebar. We've made navigation more explicit by requiring users to click a dedicated button rather than the comment itself.
</Warning>

### Improvements
- [**Comments**]: Added navigation button as default in Comments Sidebar. Now just clicking on a comment doesn't open the comment on the DOM. A lot of users reported this behaviour as frustrating. That's why now there is an explicit navigation button for that. You will still get the [`onCommentClick`](/async-collaboration/comments-sidebar/customize-behavior#oncommentclick) event. You can still use that to maintain the old behavior [using this](/async-collaboration/comments/customize-behavior/customize-behavior#selectcommentbyannotationid).
- [**Comments**]: Added feature to show resolved comments on for inline comments section.
- [**Comments**]: Disabled collapsed comments by default. Most customers don't want to show collapsed comments by default so we disabled it. You can enable it by setting using [this](/async-collaboration/comments/customize-behavior/customize-behavior#enablecollapsedcomments).
- [**Comments**]: Disabled auto-focus on new comments in inline comments section and sidebar page mode.


### Bug Fixes
- [**Comments**]: Fixed inline comment section horizontal scroll issue when the available width is too narrow.
- [**Comments**]: Fixed Composer Send Button vertical alignment.
- [**Comments**]: Removed autofocus for inline comments section when the page loads.
- [**Comments**]: Fixed issue where clicking composer in edit mode was passing clicks through to the sidebar.
- [**Comments**]: Fixed copy paste replace issue in the composer where pasting text over selected text was not working correctly.
- [**Comments**]: Fixed Velt Button Sidebar wireframe loading default UI initially.
- [**Comments**]: Fixed unread comments count APIs to return correct values on document switch.
