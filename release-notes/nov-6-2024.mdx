# 3.0.58

### Improvements

- [**Comments**]: Added ability to sort inline comments:
  - `asc`: Show comments in ascending order of last updated timestamp
  - `desc`: Show comments in descending order of last updated timestamp
  - `none`: Show comments in order of creation (default)

  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="React / Next.js">
      ```jsx
      <VeltInlineCommentsSection sortData="desc" />
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Other Frameworks">
      ```html
      <velt-inline-comments-section sort-data="asc"></velt-inline-comments-section> 
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

- [**Comments**]: Further improved how empty comments are handled:
  - Empty comments are now hidden from the sidebar and sidebar button count
  - In popover mode, clicking a new comment button discards any previous empty comment

- [**Comments**]: Added delete option for each comment in annotations when user has admin privileges
