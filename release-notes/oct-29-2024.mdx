# 3.0.53

### New Features

- [**Comments**]: Now comments are supported on elements with duplicate DOM IDs.
  - This is useful in cases where you have multiple instances of the same data component on a page and want the comment to appear on each instance, eg: Popover comments on a table.
  - By default, comments appear on all matching elements. Use the `sourceId` attribute to control which element displays the comment dialog when adding a new comment.
  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="React / Next.js">

      <VeltCommentTool sourceId="sourceId1" />
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Other Frameworks">
      ```html
      <velt-comment-tool source-id="sourceId1"></velt-comment-tool>
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

### Improvements

- [**Comments**]: In multithread mode, now you can deselect a thread by clicking on the header of the multi-thread dialog.
- [**Comments**]: Removed self user from the list of users in the "Seen By" dropdown.
- [**Comments**]: Removed users without name and email from the list of users in the "Seen By" dropdown.

### Bug Fixes

- [**Tiptap Comments**]: Removed `data-velt-content` attribute. Now the highlighted text styling is only applied to text when there are comments available.
- [**Comments**]: Fixed an issue where undefined and null string values appeared in individual and group contact lists.
