# 3.0.33

### Improvements

- [**Console Debugger**]: Added logs for `addContext` and `updateContext` methods. The context object is now included in the log event properties for better debugging and tracking.
- [**Comments**]: Now comments will be marked as read if opened via the `selectCommentByAnnotationId()` API.


### Bug Fixes
- [**Comment Display**]: Improved comment rendering performance for Comments Sidebar.


# 3.0.32

### New Features

- [**Comments Sidebar**]: Added a reset filter button to easily clear all applied filters.
  - This new button allows users to quickly reset all filters in the comments sidebar when no comments are available for the applied filters.
  - Here is the wireframe for the reset filter button:
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="React / Next.js">
    ```jsx
    <VeltCommentsSidebarWireframe.ResetFilterButton />
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="HTML">
    ```html
    <velt-comments-sidebar-reset-filter-button-wireframe></velt-comments-sidebar-reset-filter-button-wireframe>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
