# 3.0.13

### New Features
- [**Comments**]: Added Draft State:
  - Empty comments are no longer saved.
  - Partial comments are saved as drafts, visible only to the author.
  - Draft creation:
    - Comment is saved as draft when the user adds text, recording, or attachment and closes the comment dialog without submitting.
    - On first attempt to close: Dialog shakes to indicate draft status.
    - On second attempt: the comment is saved as draft and the dialog closes.
  - Added a visual indicator for draft comments in the dialog.
  - If you had previously used a wireframe for the comment dialog, you will need to add the [draft wireframe](/ui-customization/features/async/comments/comment-dialog/subcomponents/body/subcomponents/threadcard).
