# 3.0.22

## New Features
- [**Console**]: Added configuration option for base64 encoding of webhook payloads (disabled by default).
  - Addresses issues with payloads containing HTML tags that may fail due to strict endpoint policies.
  - Ensures payload validity and processability by your endpoint.
  - Example of decoding a base64 encoded payload:
``` js
const encodedData="eyJ0ZXN0IjoxLCJ0ZXN0MSI6IjxkaXY+PC9kaXY+In0="
const decodedData = Buffer.from(encodedData, 'base64').toString('utf-8');
console.log(JSON.parse(decodedData));
```

  - Refined composer show/hide logic for a more intuitive user experience
  - Shortened the displayed timestamp format
