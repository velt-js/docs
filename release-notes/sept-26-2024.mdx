# 3.0.23

## New Features
- [**Console**]: Added configuration option for base64 encoding of webhook payloads (disabled by default).
  - Addresses issues with payloads containing HTML tags that may fail due to strict endpoint policies.
  - Ensures payload validity and processability by your endpoint.
  - Example of decoding a base64 encoded payload:
``` js
const encodedData="eyJ0ZXN0IjoxLCJ0ZXN0MSI6IjxkaXY+PC9kaXY+In0="
const decodedData = Buffer.from(encodedData, 'base64').toString('utf-8');
console.log(JSON.parse(decodedData));
```


## Improvements

- [**Comments**]: Significant enhancements to the comments UX in multithread mode:
  - Implemented smooth auto-scroll animation to new threads for improved visibility
  - Added a new comment button to the header for easier thread creation
  - Refined composer show/hide logic for a more intuitive user experience
  - Shortened the displayed timestamp format

- [**Comments**]: Improved the UI for [custom autocomplete dropdown chip](async-collaboration/comments/customize-behavior/custom-lists#2-add-custom-lists-on-comment).

- [**Notifications**]: Notifications feature and API no longer require documentId to be set for initialization.

## Bug Fixes
- [**Comments**]: Fixed an issue where the custom autocomplete chip would fail to render if the same chip is added multiple times.
