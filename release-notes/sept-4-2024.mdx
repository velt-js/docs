# 3.0.3

## New Features

- [**Comments**]: Added a minimal filtering and sorting dropdown in the sidebar wireframe. By default it's not enabled. You need to explicitly add the wireframe to the sidebar. It includes options like:
- Filter by `All`
- Filter by `Unread`
- Filter by `Read`
- Filter by `Resolved`
- Sort by `Unread`
- Sort by `Last Updated Timestamp`

## Bug Fixes

- [**Comments**]: Fixed an issue where the dialog was overflowing out of the screen in some cases.
