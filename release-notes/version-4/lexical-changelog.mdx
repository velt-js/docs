<Update label="4.5.2-beta.3" description="December 12, 2025">

### Improvements

- [**Comments**]: Refactored `@veltdev/lexical-velt-comments` to follow a common pattern and folder structure across all libraries. This enables faster development of Velt comment integrations and covers more rich text editor scenarios.

### New Features
- [**Lexical**]: Released documentation for our Lexical CRDT integration. Also added a new `exportJSONWithoutComments` utility to serialize editor content without including comment nodes.

```javascript
import { exportJSONWithoutComments } from '@veltdev/lexical-velt-comments';

const cleanState = exportJSONWithoutComments(editor);
```
