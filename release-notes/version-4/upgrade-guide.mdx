    - Subscribe, view, and perform CRUD operations across multiple documents in real-time
    - Comments from multiple documents are now automatically rendered in the Sidebar

    - Query comments, comment counts, unread counts across multiple documents with a simpler API
    - Filter by document IDs, location IDs, and status IDs


## How to Upgrade
Use these steps with your test API key first. Once you are ready, follow the same steps on production API keys as well.

1. Ensure you are using `organizationId` vs `groupId` in the `identify` method. If you have existing data with groupId, then first migrate your data using the [data page in Velt Console](https://console.velt.dev/dashboard/data/organization).
2. Enable 'Advanced Queries and Filters' in the Velt Console [here](https://console.velt.dev/dashboard/config/appconfig). It will take 15 mins for this to be enabled.
3. Once, the feature is enabled, deploy the latest version of the Velt SDK to your product.
