title: Upgrade Guide
---

## Overview
- This is currently in `beta`.
- **Key improvements in this series will focus on**:
  - Advanced data querying capabilities
  - Enhanced security features
  - Powerful customization capabilities that will require significantly less code than before
- We are adding support for multiple document operations:
  - **Multi-Document Handling**:
    - Work with multiple Velt documents on a single page simultaneously
    - Subscribe, view, and perform CRUD operations across multiple documents in real-time
    - Comments from multiple documents are now automatically rendered in the Sidebar
  - **Enhanced Querying**:
    - Query comments, comment counts, unread counts across multiple documents with a simpler API
    - Filter by document IDs, location IDs, and status IDs


## Breaking Changes
- [**Authentication**] Made `organizationId` mandatory in `identify` method.
- [**UI Customization**] If you applied CSS to wireframe component selectors, you need to update them to target Velt component selectors directly.
  - Wireframe components are no longer rendered within Velt components. In previous versions, there were a few wireframe components that were rendered within Velt components.
  - If you are an existing customer who is impacted, reach out and we will provide you the updated CSS for your implementation.

## How to Upgrade
Use these steps with your test API key first. Once you are ready, follow the same steps on all your production API keys as well.

1. Ensure you are using `organizationId` vs `groupId` in the `identify` method. If you have existing data with groupId, then first migrate your data using [this guide](#migrating-from-groupid-to-organizationid).
2. Enable 'Advanced Queries and Filters' in the Velt Console [here](https://console.velt.dev/dashboard/config/appconfig). It will take 15-30 mins for this to be enabled in your API key depending on the size of your data.
3. Once, the feature is enabled, deploy the latest version of the Velt SDK to your product.



### Migrating from `groupId` to `organizationId`
Use these steps with your test API key first. Once you are ready, follow the same steps on all your production API keys as well.
1. Change the `groupId` field to `organizationId` in the `identify` method. Once you do this, you will stop seeing the existing data locally. This is expected.
2. Goto the [data page in Velt Console](https://console.velt.dev/dashboard/data/organization). You will see an option to migrate data to `organizationId` structure.
3. Click on the `Migrate` button. The migration will take 15-30 mins to complete depending on the size of your data.
4. Once, the migration is done, you will start seeing the data. Your original `groupId` data will be retained as backup.
5. Deploy your changes to production. Note: Deploy soon after the migration completes to minimize any data inconsistency.
