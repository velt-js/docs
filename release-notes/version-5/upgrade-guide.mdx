title: Upgrade Guide
---

## Overview
- **Key improvements in this series**:
  - Introduced 115+ primitive components for building custom comments UI with maximum flexibility.
  - Each primitive component can now be used independently without requiring the full dialog structure
  - Two usage patterns: ID-Based and Context Wrapper


## Breaking Changes
- [**CSS Element Names**] If you applied CSS to comment dialog element selectors, you need to update them to target the new element names.
  - Replace `snippyly-comment-dialog` with `velt-comment-dialog-internal`
  - Replace `app-comment-dialog-*` pattern with `velt-comment-dialog-*-internal`
  - For example: `app-comment-dialog-composer` becomes `velt-comment-dialog-composer-internal`
  - **Important**: Only element names need to be updated. Class names remain unchanged.


## How to Upgrade

1. Search your CSS files for any element selectors using `snippyly-comment-dialog` or `app-comment-dialog-*` patterns.
2. Update the element selectors using the following replacements:

| Old Element Name | New Element Name |
|------------------|------------------|
| `snippyly-comment-dialog` | `velt-comment-dialog-internal` |
| `app-comment-dialog-composer` | `velt-comment-dialog-composer-internal` |
| `app-comment-dialog-header` | `velt-comment-dialog-header-internal` |
| `app-comment-dialog-body` | `velt-comment-dialog-body-internal` |

3. Deploy the latest version of the Velt SDK to your product.

<Note>
If you are only using class selectors (e.g., `.comment-dialog-composer`), no changes are required.
