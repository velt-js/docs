title: Proxy Server
---

If you want to use a Proxy Server, such as `nginx`, to redirect to the Velt SDK instead of using our servers, you can pass a `proxyDomain` to the configuration prop of the `VeltProvider`.

Example:
```jsx
<VeltProvider 
  config={{
    proxyDomain: 'https://cdn.velt.dev'
  }}
></VeltProvider>
```

## Proxy Path

We will append `/lib/sdk@[VERSION_NUMBER]/velt.js` to the end of your `proxyDomain` to use as the full proxy path. Make sure that you host the proxy in the correct path.

Example: if you pass `https://cdn.velt.dev` as the `proxyDomain`, we will use `https://cdn.velt.dev/lib/sdk@[VERSION_NUMBER]/velt.js` as the full proxy path.
