# Self-Hosting Data

Velt allows you to self-host sensitive content while still using most of the collaboration features and components:

- **Comments**: Store comment content on your infrastructure with only identifiers on Velt servers
- **In-app notifications**: In-app notification content is automatically handled when you use comments and reactions self-hosted solutions
- **Reactions**: Store reaction data on your systems with only identifiers on Velt servers
- **Users**: Store sensitive user PII on your servers, with only identifiers on Velt servers

For each data type, you configure a data provider that implements specific methods (get, save, delete) to interact with your database. Velt Components automatically hydrate data in the frontend by fetching from your configured providers.

This approach gives you complete control and ownership of your data while maintaining all Velt collaboration features and real-time functionality.

<Warning>
Email notifications via Velt's SendGrid integration are not available when you self-host comment content. Since the content lives on your infrastructure, Velt cannot construct and send emails via the sendgrid integration. Instead, use [Webhooks](/webhooks/basic) to receive events (e.g., mentions, replies), fetch the relevant comment/notification content from your database, and send emails from your own email provider.
</Warning>

# Supported Infrastructure
