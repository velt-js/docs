<Update label="4.5.6-beta.17" description="October 17, 2025">

### New Features

- [**Comments**]: Added `markAsRead()` and `markAsUnread()` methods to mark comment annotations as read or unread for the current user.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="React / Next.js">
```jsx
// Using Hooks
const commentElement = useCommentUtils();

commentElement.markAsUnread("eUgq6G6zXxJmOT9eBXtT");
commentElement.markAsRead("eUgq6G6zXxJmOT9eBXtT");

// Using API methods
const commentElement = client.getCommentElement();

commentElement.markAsUnread("eUgq6G6zXxJmOT9eBXtT");
commentElement.markAsRead("eUgq6G6zXxJmOT9eBXtT");
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Other Frameworks">
```jsx
const commentElement = Velt.getCommentElement();

commentElement.markAsUnread("eUgq6G6zXxJmOT9eBXtT");
commentElement.markAsRead("eUgq6G6zXxJmOT9eBXtT");
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Improvements

- [**Recorder**]: Added system sound capture when recording a browser tab.

- [**Comments**]: You can now tag users by copy-pasting their email address. Previously, only manually typed emails worked for tagging users not on the contact list.

- [**Comments**]: Added `viewedBy` and `reactionAnnotations` fields to comment annotation objects returned via REST APIs including [Get Comment Annotations](/api-reference/rest-apis/v2/comments-feature/comment-annotations/get-comment-annotations-v2) and [Get Comments](/api-reference/rest-apis/v2/comments-feature/comments/get-comments). These fields provide enhanced visibility into user engagement and reactions.

**`viewedBy`**: An array of User objects representing who has seen and read the comment annotation. Use this to track engagement, identify which stakeholders have reviewed feedback, or build custom read receipt indicators.

**`reactionAnnotations`**: An array of complete ReactionAnnotation objects containing the full reaction data for each comment. Each object includes the reaction ID, icon, user information, and metadata. Use this to display reaction counts, show who reacted with what emoji, or build custom reaction analytics.

```typescript
// Comment Annotation Object
{
    ...
    comments: [
        {
            ...
            reactionAnnotations?: ReactionAnnotation[]; // Complete reaction objects with full details
        }
    ],
    viewedBy?: User[]; // Users who have seen and read this annotation
}
```

### Bug Fixes

- [**Recorder**]: Fixed an issue in the video editor where the playhead position was ignored after playback ended. When seeking or dragging the playhead after video completion, playback now correctly starts from the new position instead of always starting from the beginning.

### Improvements

- [**Comments**]: Released v2 improved version of comment anchoring that makes comment positioning more dynamic and robust on more dynamic websites. This includes enhanced element detection for pin, text, and area comments, improved cursor display based on DOM element visibility, and better handling of image tag positioning with conditional relative positioning for container elements.

<Update label="4.5.6-beta.15" description="October 16, 2025">

### Bug Fixes

- [**Comments**]: Fixed an issue where draft comments with resolvers were incorrectly submitted before being finalized, causing data inconsistencies. Draft comments with resolvers now work properly and are only saved when explicitly published.

- [**Access Control**]: Fixed an issue where organization access permissions were not being set correctly when using the permission provider. When users logged in, their organization-level permissions were failing to initialize properly. Organization access now gets assigned correctly during the identification process.
