## Disable ShadowDOM
ShadowDOM is not used in this component. You can apply your styling directly to the component.


## Dark Mode

This component takes the dark mode property from the parent feature (eg: comments) where this used.
If the parent feature component is in dark mode, this component will also be in dark mode.
