<Steps>

<Step title="Select the part you want to modify">
We offer several parts which can be used like classes. Full list below.

The component is encapsulated in Shadow DOM, which is isolated from the normal DOM.
</Step>

<Step title="Apply your CSS rules">
Set whatever CSS rules you want.

The part lets you target a specific element within a Shadow DOM.
</Step>

<Step title="Check out the table below">
Reference the table below to see what parts we expose.

Alternatively, you can directly inspect the component HTML to see what parts are available.

```java
velt-cursor::part(label-container) {
  border-radius: 0;
}
```
