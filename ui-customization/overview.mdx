Velt Components can be customized in 5 key ways:

1. [**Layout**](#1-layout): For structure and organization of components
2. [**Styling**](#2-styling): For visual design using CSS, themes, or your CSS framework
3. [**Template Variables**](#3-template-variables): For rendering dynamic content
4. [**Conditional Templates**](#4-conditional-templates): For custom rendering logic
5. [**Action Components**](#5-action-components): For interactivity and custom behaviors

# 1. Layout

### Understanding Wireframes

Think of Wireframes like blueprints - they're templates that let you customize how Velt components render in your app. When you create a wireframe:
- It acts as a global template
- Changes apply everywhere that component is used
- You can use your own components and HTML structure

What you can do:
- ✅ Use your own Components/HTML
- ✅ Apply your styling
- ✅ Nest regular HTML elements
- ✅ Use other Velt wireframe components
- ❌ Cannot nest regular Velt components inside wireframes

<Warning>
Empty wireframes keep Velt's default styling. Adding children removes default styles.
</Warning>

### a. Replace Layout
Replace Velt's default HTML with your own structure.

### b. Remove Components 
Remove specific parts of a Velt component you don't need.

### c. Reorder Components
Change the order of elements within a Velt component.

### d. Use Variants
Need different versions of the same component? Use variants to:
- Create multiple styled versions
- Switch between them dynamically
- Maintain consistent behavior with different looks

# 2. Styling

Velt components can be styled in two main ways:
### a. Themes
<Info>
**NEW:** Try the [Theme Playground](https://playground.velt.dev/themes) to visually customize and preview themes.
</Info>
1. **CSS Variables:** Quickest way to match your design system using CSS variables. This gets applied to all components globally. [Learn more](/ui-customization/styling#themes)
2. **Dark Mode:** Built in support for light and dark modes. [Learn more](/ui-customization/styling#dark-mode)


### b. Custom CSS or libraries
1. **Custom CSS or frameworks:** Gives you full control over the styling of Velt components using your own CSS or frameworks. This requires disabling Shadow DOM. [Learn more](/ui-customization/styling#custom-css-or-libraries)
2. **Conditional Classes:** Apply classes conditionally based available template variables. [Learn more](/ui-customization/styling#conditional-classes)


# 3. Template Variables
Template Variables let you work with dynamic data in two ways:

a. **Use Existing Velt Component Data**
   - Access and render data that's already present inside Velt components.
   - eg: Customer metadata set on comment threads.

b. **Inject Your App's Data**
   - Inject and render custom dynamic data from your application into Velt components.

# 4. Conditional Templates
Add logic to show/hide components based on the template variables.
[Learn more](/ui-customization/conditional-templates)

# 5. Action Components
- Extend the functionality of any Velt component.
- Clicking an action button provides a callback where you can write your own custom code.
