Velt Components can be customized in 5 key ways:

1. [**Layout**](#1-layout): For structure and organization of components
2. [**Styling**](#2-styling): For visual design using CSS, themes, or your CSS framework
3. [**Template Variables**](#3-template-variables): For rendering dynamic content
4. [**Conditional Templates**](#4-conditional-templates): For custom rendering logic
5. [**Action Components**](#5-action-components): For interactivity and custom behaviors

# 1. Layout

### Understanding Wireframes

Think of Wireframes like blueprints - they're templates that let you customize how Velt components render in your app. They are not functional components. Define them once, and Velt will swap in your custom template wherever a component renders, overriding the default.
When you create a wireframe:
- It acts as a global template
- Changes apply everywhere that component is used
- You can use your own components and HTML structure

**What you can do:**
- ✅ Use your own Components/HTML
- ✅ Apply your styling
- ✅ Nest regular HTML elements
- ✅ Use other Velt wireframe components

**Limitations with Wireframes:**
- ❌ Cannot nest regular Velt components inside wireframes
- ❌ Host App's dynamic variables: Won't work directly inside wireframes.
- ❌ Host App's JavaScript: Custom scripts won't run natively inside wireframes.

**How Velt solves these:**
- **Host App's dynamic variables:** Use [UI State](/ui-customization/template-variables#2-injecting-your-own-data) to inject your app's dynamic variables into Velt components seamlessly. This is available across all Velt Wireframes.
- **Host App's JavaScript:** Wrap your component in [`VeltButtonWireframe`](/ui-customization/custom-action-component). It exposes a callback. Listen for it to trigger your custom JS logic.

<Warning>
Empty wireframes keep Velt's default styling.
Adding any children to a wireframe template removes most of its default styling. This gives you full control over the layout.
However, you will still need to use a combination of CSS overrides on any remaining styles and your own components to achieve the desired styling.
</Warning>

### a. Replace Layout
Replace Velt's default HTML with your own structure.
[Learn more](/ui-customization/layout#replace-default-layout)

### b. Remove Components 
Remove specific parts of a Velt component you don't need.
[Learn more](/ui-customization/layout#remove-components)

### c. Reorder Components
Change the order of elements within a Velt component.
[Learn more](/ui-customization/layout#reorder-components)

### d. Use Variants
Need different versions of the same component? Use variants to:
- Create multiple styled versions
- Switch between them dynamically
- Maintain consistent behavior with different looks

# 2. Styling

Velt components can be styled in two main ways:
### a. Themes
<Info>
**NEW:** Try the [Theme Playground](https://playground.velt.dev/themes) to visually customize and preview themes.
</Info>
1. **CSS Variables:** Quickest way to match your design system using CSS variables. This gets applied to all components globally. [Learn more](/ui-customization/styling#themes)
2. **Dark Mode:** Built in support for light and dark modes. [Learn more](/ui-customization/styling#dark-mode)


### b. Custom CSS or libraries
1. **Custom CSS or frameworks:** Gives you full control over the styling of Velt components using your own CSS or frameworks. This requires disabling Shadow DOM. [Learn more](/ui-customization/styling#custom-css-or-libraries)
2. **Conditional Classes:** Apply classes conditionally based available template variables. [Learn more](/ui-customization/styling#conditional-classes)

<Warning>
Passing `className` or `style` to Velt components does not change their UI. Style via Wireframes (by adding your own HTML and classes inside the templates) or via CSS overrides with Shadow DOM disabled.
</Warning>


# 3. Template Variables
Template Variables let you work with dynamic data in two ways:

a. **Use Existing Velt Component Data**
   - Access and render data that's already present inside Velt components.
   - eg: Customer metadata set on comment threads.

b. **Inject Your App's Data**
   - Inject and render custom dynamic data from your application into Velt components.

[Learn more](/ui-customization/template-variables)

# 4. Conditional Templates
Add logic to show/hide components based on the template variables.
[Learn more](/ui-customization/conditional-templates)

# 5. Action Components
- Extend the functionality of any Velt component.
- Clicking an action button provides a callback where you can write your own custom code.
