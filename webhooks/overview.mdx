## Webhooks

You can provide us a webhook endpoint and we will send real time notifications data based on the events that occur.

Currently we send webhook notifications for the following events:
- [Comment Events](https://docs.velt.dev/webhooks/comments-webhooks)
- [Huddle Events](https://docs.velt.dev/webhooks/huddle-webhooks)

## Setting up a Webhook

To enable Webhooks go to the Configurations -> Webhook Service in the Velt Console, or [click here](https://console.velt.dev/dashboard/config/webhook)

Then provide the following:

 - `Webhook Auth Token` - this is an optional security feature. You can generate and set a unique auth token(string) on your velt console in the webhooks setting. We will add that to the authorization header whenever we are making a post request to your endpoint. It will come in the format of `Basic YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN`. This is so that you can validate that the request is coming from us and not a spammer.
 
 - `Processed Notification URL` - endpoint for processed notifications, usually hosted on your server and is used to process the incoming body data in Processed Format

 - `Raw Notification URL` - endpoint for processed notifications, usually hosted on your server and is used to process the incoming body data in Raw Format

## Processed vs Raw Formats

The Raw Format contains lot more metadata that might not be very useful for your notification processing.

In the Processed Format, we will automatically populate who should get what type of notification so that you dont have to write that logic. Eg: If someone was previously tagged on a comment, then they should receive an update notification vs if someone if tagged in this thread, then they should receive a notification that they were tagged in a comment.
We recommend using this so that you dont have to maintain the logic on your end.

All webhook notifications will have an `actionType` field that will describe what type of event occured.

Based on the `actionType` that occured, the rest of the schema for the webhook will be slightly different.

View the specific docs for certain webhook events to see the schemas for those types of events.
