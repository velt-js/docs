Set up a webhook endpoint to receive real-time notifications for the following Velt events:
- [Comments](/webhooks/comments-webhooks)
- [Huddle](/webhooks/huddle-webhooks)

## Setting up a Webhook

To enable Webhooks go to the Configurations -> Webhook Service in the Velt Console, or [click here](https://console.velt.dev/dashboard/config/webhook)

### **Webhook Auth Token**
- Optional security feature to authenticate webhook requests.
- Set a unique auth token in your Velt console's webhook settings.
- We add this token to the Authorization header of each request as `Basic YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN`.
- Helps you verify that requests are from Velt, not from unauthorized sources.

### **Endpoint URL**
- This is the endpoint that we will send the webhook data to. This is usually hosted on your server.

### **Payload Encoding**
- Enable Base64 encoding for webhook payloads (disabled by default).
- Addresses issues with payloads containing HTML tags that may fail due to strict endpoint policies.
- If enabled, ensure your server can decode Base64 encoded payloads.
- Example of decoding a Base64 encoded payload:

   ```js
   const encodedData = "eyJ0ZXN0IjoxLCJ0ZXN0MSI6IjxkaXY+PC9kaXY+In0="
   const decodedData = Buffer.from(encodedData, 'base64').toString('utf-8');
   console.log(JSON.parse(decodedData));
   ```
